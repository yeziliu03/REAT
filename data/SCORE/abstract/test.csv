"lottery estimates suggest massachusetts' urban charter schools boost achievement well beyond that of traditional urban public schools students, while nonurban charters reduce achievement from a higher baseline. the fact that urban charters are most effective for poor nonwhites and low-baseline achievers contributes to, but does not fully explain, these differences. we therefore link school-level charter impacts to school inputs and practices. the relative efficacy of urban lottery sample charters is accounted for by these schools' embrace of the no excuses approach to urban education. in our massachusetts sample, non-no-excuses urban charters are no more effective than nonurban charters.",1
"the study investigates the effect of immigrant bilingualism on learning english as a foreign language, controlling for confounding background variables and examining the effect of proficiency in the instructional language at school. using a sample of 2835 german 6th-graders (arabic-german: n = 105, chinese-german: n = 110, polish-german: n = 57, turkish-german: is 383, heterogeneous bilingual: n = 284, and monolingual german group: is = 1896), we examined if speaking another language at home in addition to the instructional language at school presents an advantageous condition for learning english as a foreign language. controlling for cognitive abilities, age, gender, socio-economic status, parental education, and indicators of cultural capital, the analysis revealed a general positive trend between bilingualism and english foreign language achievement. this positive trend differs significantly between bilingual groups with different home languages. the strongest predictor for foreign language learning revealed to be proficiency in the instructional language.

"dealing with representations is a crucial skill for students and such representational competence is essential for learning science. this study analysed the relationship between representational competence and content knowledge, student perceptions of teaching practices concerning the use of different representations, and their impact on students' outcome over a teaching unit. participants were 931 students in 51 secondary school classes. representational competence and content knowledge were interactively related. representational aspects were only moderately included in teaching and students did not develop rich representational competence although content knowledge increased significantly. multi-level regression showed that student perceptions of interpreting and constructing visual-graphical representations and active social construction of knowledge predicted students' outcome at class level, whereas the individually perceived amount of terms and use of symbolic representations influenced the students' achievement at individual level. methodological and practical implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the development of representational competence in classrooms.

"the predictive power of cognitive ability and self-control strength for self-reported grades and an achievement test were studied. it was expected that the variables use of time structure, academic procrastination, and motivational interference during learning further aid in predicting students' achievement because they are operative in situations of school-leisure conflict. a sample of 697 eighth-graders was tested twice within the interval of a single school year (about eight months). cognitive ability and self-control explained substantial variance of grade changes. procrastination displayed a further portion of the variance. personality variables were better predictors of grades, while cognitive ability showed higher variance with the achievement test. variables tapping aspects of self-control strength have been interpreted as key determinants of learning outcomes. the findings suggest that it might be useful to identify students who are at risk, allowing these students to train their ability to shield studying from leisure distractions.

"this study investigated the effects of feedback providing improvement strategies and a reflection assignment on students' writing motivation, process, and performance. students in the experimental feedback condition (n = 41) received feedback including improvement strategies, whereas students in the control feedback condition (n = 41) received feedback without improvement strategies. within each feedback condition, half of the students received a reflection assignment on feedback use and the revision (experimental reflection condition), while the other half received a reflection assignment on feedback perception (control reflection condition). results indicated that in the experimental feedback condition writing performance gained from the control reflection assignment, while in the control feedback condition it gained from the experimental reflection assignment. improvement strategies negatively predicted self-efficacy beliefs, especially when initial self-efficacy beliefs were low, and positively predicted planning/revising. reflections on feedback use and the revision positively predicted mastery goal when mastery goal initially was low or moderate.

"the fading of instructional scripts can be regarded as necessary for allowing learners to take over control of their cognitive activities during the acquisition of skills such as argumentation. there is, however, the danger that learners might relapse into novice strategies after script prompts are faded. one possible solution could be monitoring by a peer with respect to the performance of the strategy to be learned. we conducted a 2 x 2-factorial experiment with 126 participants with fading and peer monitoring as between-subjects factors to test the assumptions that (1) the combination of a faded script and peer monitoring has a positive effect on strategy knowledge compared to only one or none of the two types of support; and (2) this effect is due to a greater amount of self-regulated performance of the strategy after the fading of the script when peer monitoring takes place. the findings support these assumptions.

"the aim of the present longitudinal study was to investigate factors contributing to mothers' and fathers' teaching of reading and mathematics to their children during kindergarten and grade 1. it was assumed that mothers' and fathers' teaching during kindergarten would be influenced by their socioeconomic status and their own learning difficulties, whereas during grade i by their children's academic performance. a total of 189 mothers and 165 fathers filled in questionnaires regarding their teaching of reading and mathematics twice, once in kindergarten and once in grade 1. children's reading and mathematics performance was also examined twice, once in kindergarten and once in grade 1. the results showed that the lower the socioeconomic status of mothers and fathers, the more teaching of reading and mathematics they reported. moreover, the lower the children's academic performance in reading and mathematics in the beginning of grade 1, the more teaching by mothers and fathers reported later on. overall, the results suggest that mothers and fathers adjust their teaching to the actual skill level of their children when their children enter primary school.

"this study examined whether cooperative learning and feedback facilitate situated, example-based e-learning in the field of statistics. the factors ""social context"" (individual vs. cooperative) and ""feedback intervention"" (available vs. not available) were varied; participants were 137 university students. results showed that the feedback intervention clearly supported learning. feedback proved especially beneficial for students with little prior knowledge. cooperation did not promote learning outcomes; however, group performance in the learning phase was superior to individual performance. also, cooperative learning enhanced perceived performance and perceived competence. probably, collective efficacy had a halo effect on self-efficacy.

"anxiety vulnerability is associated with an attentional bias to threat. when threat cues signal dangers that can be mitigated through behavioural action, vigilance for these threat cues can have an adaptive function. it is unknown, however, whether the anxiety-linked attentional bias is maintained or eliminated in contexts where threat cues signal dangers that can be mitigated. the current study used a probe task to assess anxiety-linked attentional bias to threat cues signalling a danger (noise burst) that in one condition could and in another condition could not be mitigated. results showed that high trait anxious participants exhibited a larger attentional bias to threat than low trait anxious participants, and importantly, this anxiety-linked attentional bias did not differ as a function of danger mitigability. these findings suggest that anxiety-linked attentional bias is a rather pervasive processing style that may be insensitive to contextual variation in the adaptiveness of attending to threat.",0
"we conducted two experimental studies influenced by the overheard communication technique in which we assessed whether a depression public service announcement (d-psa) that appeared to be intended for someone else (e.g., ""do you have a friend who is depressed?"") could influence help-seeking inclinations among people with elevated depressive symptomatology. in study 1, participants (n = 335) viewed a print d-psa that was either direct or mistargeted. in study 2, participants (n = 1,195) viewed a direct or mistargeted video d-psa or no video. in support of the utility of the mistargeted-communication technique, the mistargeted d-psa resulted in significantly more help-seeking intentions from a romantic partner and close friends than did a direct d-psa among people with heightened levels of depressive symptomatology (study 1). in study 2, among people with heightened levels of depressive symptomatology, assignment to the mistargeted d-psa condition, compared with the direct d-psa and the no d-psa control conditions, resulted in more favorable attitudes and increased intentions to seek help from a website.",0
"state-of-the-art term structure models of commodity prices have serious difficulties extrapolating the prices of long-maturity futures contracts from short-dated contracts. this situation is problematic for valuing real commodity-linked assets. we estimate a nonlinear four-factor continuous time model of commodity price dynamics. the model nests many previous specifications. to estimate the model, we use crude oil prices and inventories. the inventory data and nonlinear price dynamics have a large impact on oil price forecasts. the additional factor in our model compared with current three-factor models has a significant impact on model-implied long-maturity futures prices.",0
"we develop two measures of board composition to investigate whether directors appointed by the ceo have allegiance to the ceo and decrease their monitoring. co-option is the fraction of the board comprised of directors appointed after the ceo assumed office. as co-option increases, board monitoring decreases: turnover-performance sensitivity diminishes, pay increases (without commensurate increase in pay-performance sensitivity), and investment increases. non-co-opted independence-the fraction of directors who are independent and were appointed before the ceo-has more explanatory power for monitoring effectiveness than the conventional measure of board independence. our results suggest that not all independent directors are effective monitors.",1
"relying on 2.2 million articles from forty-five national and local u.s. newspapers between 1989 and 2010, we find that firms particularly covered by the media exhibit, ceteris paribus, significantly stronger momentum. the effect depends on article tone, reverses in the long run, is more pronounced for stocks with high uncertainty, and is stronger in states with high investor individualism. our findings suggest that media coverage can exacerbate investor biases, leading return predictability to be strongest for firms in the spotlight of public attention. these results collectively lend credibility to an overreaction-based explanation for the momentum effect.",1
"this article studies bank failures in twenty-one emerging market countries in the 1990s. by using a competing risk hazard model for bank survival, we show that a government is less likely to take over or close a failing bank if the banking system is weak. this too-many-to-fail effect is robust to controlling for macroeconomic factors, financial crises, the too-big-to-fail effect, domestic financial development, and concerns due to systemic risk and information spillovers. the article also shows that the too-many-to-fail effect is stronger for larger banks and when there is a large government budget deficit.

"in the process of lending to a firm, a bank acquires proprietary firm-specific information that is unavailable to nonlenders. this asymmetric evolution of information between lenders and prospective lenders grants the former an information monopoly. this article empirically investigates whether relationship banks exploit this advantage by charging higher interest rates than those that would prevail were all banks symmetrically informed. my identification strategy hinges on the notion that large information shocks that level the playing field among banks erode the relationship bank's information monopoly. i use the borrower's initial public offering (ipo) as such an information-releasing event, and build a panel dataset in which the unit of observation is a firm's lending relationships before and after its ipo. prior to a firm's ipo, i find a u-shaped relation between borrowing rates and relationship intensity. after the ipo, interest rates are decreasing in relationship intensity. furthermore, mean interest rates drop after an ipo. the results are robust to firm and loan-year fixed effects, and to controls for firm leverage pre- and post-ipo. thus, the reported interest rate pattern is clean of any confounding effects that might arise from changes in financial risk.

"this study demonstrates the impact of systematic risk on the prices of individual equity options. the option prices are characterized by the level and slope of implied volatility curves, and the systematic risk is measured as the proportion of systematic variance in the total variance. using daily option quotes on the s, and p 100 index and its 30 largest component stocks, we show that after controlling for the underlying asset's total risk, a higher amount of systematic risk leads to a higher level of implied volatility and a steeper slope of the implied volatility curve. thus, systematic risk proportion can help differentiate the price structure across individual equity options.",1
"western governments are increasingly trying to stimulate citizens to coproduce public services by, among other strategies, offering them financial incentives. however, there are competing views on whether financial incentives stimulate coproduction. while some argue that financial incentives increase citizens' willingness to coproduce, others suggest that incentives decrease their willingness (i.e., crowding out). to test these competing expectations, the authors designed a set of experiments that offered subjects a financial incentive to assist municipalities in helping refugees integrate. the experiment was first conducted among university students within a laboratory setting. then, the initial findings were replicated and extended among a general adult sample. results suggest that small financial rewards have no effect: they neither increase nor decrease people's willingness to coproduce. when the offered amount is increased substantially, willingness to coproduce increases only marginally. hence, financial incentives are not a very cost-efficient instrument to stimulate coproduction.",1
"there are a number of influences on how long an agency head serves. the importance of particular influences, in turn, depends on the prospective destination of the agency head: elsewhere in the public sector, the private sector, or retirement. the authors estimate survival models of agency heads' tenure using panel data on british central government executive agencies from 1989 to 2012. findings suggest that chief executives of poorly performing agencies are encouraged to retire sooner. there is no evidence that a change in political control increases the risk of any form of exit, suggesting that political pressure to leave is not substantial for this type of official. outsiders-agency heads recruited from outside central government-are relatively difficult to retain for a longer time, such that potential shortfalls in suitable managers caused by retirements in an aging workforce may be difficult to make up by appointing from this source.",0
"organizational image, identity, and identification are powerful concepts in terms of understanding members' behaviors and beliefs. in particular, the term image has frequently been used to describe the overall impression of the organization, but most scholars have only focused on organizational image as it is perceived by external audiences. however, organizational image as perceived by members within an organization is critical for determining its impact on individual employees' motivation, work behaviors, and further performance at work. this article explores the roles of organizational image and identification in explaining organizational behaviorsextra-role behavior and absenteeismin public and nonprofit organizations. a series of seemingly unrelated regressions were used to analyze survey data from 1,220 respondents. results show that organizational image is positively related to employee identification, and identification has a significant influence on promoting extra-role behavior and lowering employee absenteeism.",1
"this article explores whether union commitment dampens public sector job satisfaction. by examining the connection between union commitment and two workplace attributes that are presumed to be more prevalent in public sector workplaces-perceptions of higher red tape and greater public service motivation-this article develops three hypotheses exploring the direct and indirect relationships between union commitment and public sector job satisfaction. the findings from a series of structural equation models indicate that union commitment directly increases members' job satisfaction, but it more prominently increases members' job satisfaction indirectly by reducing perceived red tape and enhancing public service motivation.",0
"despite the abundance of red tape literature and the growing popularity of outsourcing in the public sector, no study has yet investigated red tape in consulting relationships. using survey data from public managers and the contractors with whom they work, the authors investigate public managers' and private consultants' perceptions of organizational and contracting red tape. they identify the determinants of red tape perceptions, variation in those perceptions, and the characteristics of respondents with stronger divergent views of contracting red tape. the results indicate that government managers perceive higher levels of organizational red tape and contracting red tape than their consultants. public managers' perceptions of red tape are associated with job satisfaction and time spent managing and communicating with consultants. consultants' perceptions of red tape are associated with perceptions of the appropriateness of the government agency's rules, the number of years the firm has worked with the agency, and the percentage of the firm's cost-plus contracts.",1
"there is high interest in economic development efforts involving cooperation or collaboration among metropolitan jurisdictions. to determine why some local governments engage in cooperative agreements while others do not, this paper investigates transaction obstacles, including bargaining, information, agency, enforcement, and division problems. the authors then advance an institutional collective action explanation for intergovernmental cooperation, focusing on the conditions under which these transactions costs are low. this work anticipates that the costs associated with interlocal cooperation are influenced by the demographic characteristics of communities, local political institutions, and the nature of regional government networks. empirical analysis based on a national survey of local development officials provides support for several predictions from this model and identifies policy variables that, in turn, increase the prospects for cooperation, specifically through the development of informal policy networks.",0
"this paper explores the attention regulation challenges brought by interruptions. in contrast to much of the research on interruptions that looks at the effects on the interrupted task, this paper examines the difficulty of focusing attention and performing well on interrupting tasks. integrating research on attention residue, time pressure, and implementation intention, we predict that when people anticipate resuming their interrupted work under time pressure, they will find it difficult to switch their attention to the interrupting task, leading to attention residue and low performance. a ready-to-resume intervention, in which one briefly reflects on and plans one's return to the interrupted task, mitigates this effect such that attention residue is reduced and performance on the interrupting task does not suffer. data collected across four studies support these hypotheses.",1
"we examine the contingencies that sway independent noncore directors of s&p 500 firms to heed the norms of the corporate elite or the disciplining forces of the efficient directorial labor market in the context of executive entrenchment. we find support for the corporate elite perspective as the number of independent noncore directors is positively associated with an entrenchment index score. however, the positive association is moderated by contextual factors that influence whether these directors reflect the expectations of the corporate elite or the efficient directorial labor market. specifically, this study shows that the association becomes more positive when these directors are highly embedded in the corporate elite network or have shorter board tenure but less positive when independent chief executive officer directors' equity ownership is high. we also found a crossover interaction effect where the association is negative (positive) when firm performance is low (high). these results shed light on an underexplored group of independent directors that play an increasing role in the effective governance of publicly listed firms.",0
"in research and development (r&d) alliances, the partner firms must balance the tension between knowledge sharing knowledge leakages because knowledge sharing, designed to support the alliance's technology development goals, can often lead to unintended and potentially damaging knowledge leakages. governance structure is a well-understood knowledge protection strategy designed to reduce knowledge leakage concerns and thereby encourage desired knowledge transfers in two-party r&d alliances. whether governance structure can be an important balancing mechanism for r&d alliances with multiple partner firms, or multilateral r&d alliances, however, requires further study. because increasing the number of alliance partners introduces additional complexities to managing an alliance, the appropriate governance mechanism for a multilateral r&d alliance is likely to differ from that for a bilateral alliance. drawing insights from social exchange theory, we explore governance decisions in multilateral r&d alliances. first, we examine the potential for variance between multilateral and bilateral r&d alliances in governance decisions as a means of knowledge sharing and knowledge protection. results based on our analysis of 2,423 r&d alliances, 1,690 bilateral and 733 multilateral, are consistent with predictions drawn from social exchange theory. we next focus on three-partner r&d alliances, or trilateral r&d alliances, and compare governance mechanisms between two types of trilateral r&d alliances: chain and net. we find that equity governance structures are more likely to be used in net-based than in chain-based trilateral r&d alliances; we also find that alliance scope moderates the relationship between the type of alliance and governance structure. finally, we find that multilateral r&d alliances with predicted (aligned) governance structures perform better, in terms of alliance longevity, than those with misaligned structures.",1
"studies have found that students struggle to challenge their peers and engage in co-construction of knowledge when in asynchronous problem-based learning (pbl) contexts. in other settings, case libraries have been shown to support problem solving competencies, such as argumentation and problem representation. however, research has yet to study how the design and types of cases impact learner-learner interaction. to accommodate that gap, this study used content analysis and sequential analysis to ascertain how learner interaction differed when participants had access to success- and failure-based case libraries. results found the failure-based condition had higher overall number of postings and differed in terms of the number of elicitations and planning (meta) interactions. finally, results of the sequential analysis indicated participants in the success-based condition were more likely to begin planning their final assignment earlier, while the failure condition was more likely to continue engaged in collaborative problem-solving with their peers. given these differences, the findings suggest failure-based cases may serve as a catalyst for learner-learner interaction when compared with success-based cases. implications for practice, case-based reasoning, and failure-driven memory theory are discussed.",0
"tangible user interfaces offer new ways of interaction with virtual objects, yet little research has been conducted on their learner-friendly design in the context of spatial learning. although frameworks such as embodied cognition stress the importance of sensory perception and movement, studies have found that high interactivity can be overwhelming and may lead to a lower learning performance. in a 2 × 2 factorial design participants (n = 96) learned heart anatomy using a 3d model that was either controlled using a mouse or a tangible object, i.e. a motion tracked plastic model of the virtual heart. secondly, we varied the interaction mode featuring either a selective pointing mode in which only the label that the user currently activated was displayed or permanent display of all labels. retention performance, cognitive load scores, and motivation measures indicate that the tangible object leads to significantly higher learning outcomes. the effect of the label display mode is different for the two input devices: the performance with selective pointing in the mouse condition is better than the performance with permanent display in the mouse condition; in the tui condition this is exactly the other way around. based on these results, we propose extensions for embodied cognition and cognitive load theory.",0
"the literature on small stand-alone teams has suggested that decentralization has predominantly positive features. however, in multiteam systems, the presence of other highly interdependent teams adds a level of complexity that may preclude generalizing from teams to multiteam systems. we studied the effects of decentralized planning in 210 multiteam systems, each composed of three six-person, functionally specialized component teams. as has previous research, we find that decentralized planning has positive effects on multiteam system performance, attributable to enhanced proactivity and aspiration levels. however, we also find that the positive effects associated with decentralized planning are offset by the even stronger negative effects attributable to excessive risk seeking and coordination failures. we discuss the implications for theories of intrateam and interteam dynamics, along with the applied implications for designing empowerment interventions in team and multiteam contexts.",0
"we explore how television broadcasting of unrelated criminal justice events affects sentencing. exploiting as-good-as-random variation in news content before a verdict, we find that sentences are 3 months longer when the verdict is reached after coverage of crime. sentences increase with media exposure to crime, not crime itself, and the effect tapers off quickly. our results suggest that professional experience and expertise mitigate the effect of irrelevant external information. this paper highlights the influence of noise in the news cycle: media can temporarily influence decisions by changing what is top of the mind rather than signaling deeper changes in offending or societal concerns.",1
"this paper documents the gender gap in performance among high-skilled professionals in the united states. on the basis of widely used performance measures in law firms, we find that male lawyers bill 10 percent more hours and bring in more than twice as much new client revenue as female lawyers. the differential impact across genders in the presence of young children and differences in aspirations to become a law firm partner account for a large share of the difference in performance. we show that accounting for performance has important consequences for gender gaps in lawyers' earnings and subsequent promotion.",1
"exploiting regression discontinuity designs in brazilian, indian, and canadian first-past-the-post elections, we document that second-place candidates are substantially more likely than close third-place candidates to run in, and win, subsequent elections. since both candidates lost the election and had similar electoral performance, this is the effect of being labeled the runner-up. selection into candidacy is unlikely to explain the effect on winning subsequent elections, and we find no effect of finishing in third place versus fourth place. we develop a simple model of strategic coordination by voters that rationalizes the results and provides further predictions that are supported by the data.",1

"economic variables move asymmetrically over the business cycle: quickly during crises but slowly during recoveries. i show that this asymmetry is stronger in countries with less developed financial systems and greater financial frictions. then i explain this fact using a learning model with endogenous information about economic conditions. financial frictions, which i capture by higher bankruptcy costs, magnify the reaction of lending rates and economic activity to negative shocks and then delay their recovery by restricting information after the crisis. empirical evidence and a quantitative exploration of the model show that this explanation is consistent with the data.",0
"philosophers, psychologists, and economists have long argued that certain decision rights carry not only instrumental value but may also be valuable for their own sake. the ideas of autonomy, freedom, and liberty derive their intuitive appealat least partlyfrom an assumed positive intrinsic value of decision rights. providing clean evidence for the existence of this intrinsic value and measuring its size, however, is intricate. here, we develop a method capable of achieving these goals. the data reveal that the large majority of our subjects intrinsically value decision rights beyond their instrumental benefit. the intrinsic valuation of decision rights has potentially important consequences for corporate governance, human resource management, and optimal job design: it may explain why managers value power, why employees appreciate jobs with task discretion, why individuals sort into self-employment, and why the reallocation of decision rights is often very difficult and cumbersome. our method and results may also prove useful in developing an empirical revealed preference foundation for concepts such as freedom of choice and individual autonomy.",1
"in this paper, we derive and experimentally test a theoretical model of speculation in multiperiod asset markets with public information flows. the speculation arises from the traders' heterogeneous posteriors as they make different inferences from sequences of public information. this leads to overpricing in the sense that price exceeds the most optimistic belief about the real value of the asset. we find evidence of speculative overpricing in both incomplete and complete markets, where the information flow is a gradually revealed sequence of imperfect public signals about the state of the world. we also find evidence of asymmetric price reaction to good news and bad news, another feature of equilibrium price dynamics under our model. markets with a relaxed short-sale constraint exhibit less overpricing.",0
"we present evidence on the effect of social connections between workers and managers on productivity in the workplace. to evaluate whether the existence of social connections is beneficial to the firm's overall performance, we explore how the effects of social connections vary with the strength of managerial incentives and worker's ability. to do so, we combine panel data on individual worker's productivity from personnel records with a natural field experiment in which we engineered an exogenous change in managerial incentives, from fixed wages to bonuses based on the average productivity of the workers managed. we find that when managers are paid fixed wages, they favor workers to whom they are socially connected irrespective of the worker's ability, but when they are paid performance bonuses, they target their effort toward high ability workers irrespective of whether they are socially connected to them or not. although social connections increase the performance of connected workers, we find that favoring connected workers is detrimental for the firm's overall performance.",0
"we examine the effects of a quasi-experimental unconditional household income transfer on child emotional and behavioral health and personality traits. using longitudinal data, we find that there are large beneficial effects on children's emotional and behavioral health and personality traits during adolescence. we find evidence that these effects are most pronounced for children who start out with the lowest initial endowments. the income intervention also results in improvements in parental relationships which we interpret as a potential mechanism behind our findings.",0
"private equity critics claim that leveraged buyouts bring huge job losses and few gains in operating performance. to evaluate these claims, we construct and analyze a new dataset that covers us buyouts from 1980 to 2005. we track 3,200 target firms and their 150,000 establishments before and after acquisition, comparing to controls defined by industry, size, age, and prior growth. buyouts lead to modest net job losses but large increases in gross job creation and destruction. buyouts also bring tfp gains at target firms, mainly through accelerated exit of less productive establishments and greater entry of highly productive ones.",1
"we perform an experimental study to assess the effect of complexity on asset trading. we find that higher complexity leads to increased price volatility, lower liquidity, and decreased trade efficiency especially when repeated bargaining takes place. however, the channel through which complexity acts is not simply due to the added noise induced by estimation error. rather, complexity alters the bidding strategies used by traders, making them less inclined to trade, even when we control for estimation error across treatments. as such, it appears that adverse selection plays an important role in explaining the trading abnormalities caused by complexity.",0

"low-socioeconomic status (ses) students are underrepresented at selective colleges, but the role that admissions offices play is poorly understood. because admissions offices often have inconsistent information on high school contexts, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine whether providing detailed information on high school contexts increases the likelihood that admissions officers (n = 311) would recommend admitting low-ses applicants. admissions officers in the detailed-information condition were 13 to 14 percentage points (i. e., 26%-28%) more likely to recommend admitting a low-ses applicant from an underserved high school than those in the limited-information condition, although the limited-information condition provided significant details about family ses and high school context. these findings were consistent regardless of the selectivity of the college, admissions office practices, and participant demographics.",0
"we examine whether institutions' monitoring effectiveness is related to the number of their blockholdings. we find that the number of blocks that a firm's large institutions hold is positively associated with forced chief executive officer (ceo) turnover-performance sensitivity, abnormal returns around forced ceo turnover announcements and 13d filings, and changes in firm value. these results are particularly evident when institutions have multiple blockholdings in the same industry, when they have activism experience, or when they have long-term blockholdings in their portfolio firms. our results suggest that information advantages and governance experience obtained from multiple blockholdings are important channels through which institutions perform effective monitoring.

"the finance industry has grown, financial markets have become more liquid, information technology has been revolutionized. but have financial market prices become more informative? we derive a welfare-based measure of price informativeness: the predicted variation of future cash flows from current market prices. since 1960, price informativeness has increased at longer horizons (three to five years). the increase is concentrated among firms with greater institutional ownership and share turnover, firms with options trading, and growth firms. prices have also become a stronger predictor of investment, and investment a stronger predictor of cash flows. these findings suggest increased revelatory price efficiency.

"ensuring that managers engage in fair behaviors is critical for the effective functioning of organizations. previous research has focused on increasing the enactment of interactional justice (i.e., justice as a dependent variable) by enhancing managers' willingness to be fair. drawing upon the limited strength model of self-regulation, we argue that the enactment of interactional justice may not depend solely on managers' willingness or motivation but also on the extent to which managers have the self-regulatory resources required to engage in these behaviors. using four experimental studies, our results indicate that the depletion of self-regulatory resources is negatively associated with the enactment of interactional justice. furthermore, we argue that depletion can give rise to self-appraisal gaps (i.e., individuals' ability to accurately appraise the fairness of their behavior is hampered), which can diminish the impetus to regulate fair behaviors (i.e., diminish interactional justice). results provide support for self-appraisal gaps as an underlying explanation for why depletion can negatively affect the enactment of interactional justice. moreover, the negative effects of depletion can be overcome by increasing managers' awareness that they may be overestimating the fairness of their behavior. theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",1
"newly collected data from samples obtained from two different populationsundergraduate business students and part-time (i.e., evening) mba studentswere compared with data from samples obtained from the same two populations during each of the three previous decades (n = 1,818) to examine the correspondence between self-descriptions and descriptions of a good manager. both stability and change in the correspondence between self- and good-manager descriptions were predicted. providing strong support for stability, the correspondence between self- and good-manager descriptions was greater for men than women for all data combined as well as for data collected at each point in time. however, despite changes in women's status and in views of effective leadership across the four decades in which data were collected, the correspondence between self- and good-manager descriptions exhibited a lack of support for consistent change over time for women and men considered separately. implications for the nature of the linkages among sex, gender, and leadership as well as implications for individuals and organizations are discussed.",1
"this article explores antecedents and outcomes of group-level person-group (pg) fit perceptions. based on the categorization-elaboration model (cem), the authors explain how social category (gender and age) and informational diversity (education and work experience) in work teams may elicit supplementary and complementary fit perceptions among team members. the authors then examine two mechanisms through which perceived fit might influence leader-rated group performance. supplementary fit (similarity on values) is hypothesized to work through a relationship-oriented mechanism by influencing social cohesion. complementary fit (abilities meet job demands) is expected to work through a task-oriented mechanism by influencing the teams' transactive memory systems. participants include employees (n = 1,101) and leaders (n = 116) from 116 work teams in two private firms located in seoul, korea. results generally support the hypothesized relationships, with the task-oriented mechanism being more influential of group performance. post hoc analyses also suggest that a superordinate perception of pg fit may underlie the assessments of the more specific types of fit. the authors conclude that diversity within groups influences an emergent perception of group-level fit, having related supplementary and complementary components, which in turn are associated with group-level outcomes.",1
"the authors examine the mediating role of competitive intensity in the relationship between managerial racial diversity and firm performance (i.e., market share gain and average stock return). racial diversity relates to firm performance via firms' capacity to compete intensively (i.e., to introduce new competitive actions frequently). an analysis reveals that environmental munificence moderates competitive intensity's mediating effect: racially diverse management groups compete more intensively and perform better when they compete in munificent environments. the authors also find support for a moderated mediation model that simultaneously tests all components of their framework.",0
"in this two-study article, the authors investigate the mechanism through which supervisory family support is linked to outcome variables and examine the moderating effect of family-friendly benefits on this relationship. drawing on social exchange theory, they propose and find that the quality of leader-member exchange, a form of social exchange relationships, mediated the relationship between supervisory family support and work-related outcomes in study 1 (n = 82). furthermore, in study 2 (n = 225), the model linking supervisory family support to outcome variables through social exchange relationships was moderated by the level of family-friendly benefits offered by the organization. implications for research and practice are discussed.",0
"an extensive amount of research has been conducted regarding the various advantages and disadvantages posed by engaging in market pioneering behavior at the product level. however, relatively little research examines factors that facilitate the relationship between a firm's overall pioneering orientation and firm growth. this article investigates pioneering as an orientation that a firm adopts in pursuing a proactive introduction of new products to the market across product lines. in doing so, this study examines organizational and industry factors that impact the relationship between pioneering orientation and firm growth and proposes that this main effect relationship will be curvilinear (inverted u shaped). further, this study hypothesizes that an organization's ability to strategically learn will positively moderate the relationship between pioneering orientation and firm growth. additionally, this study hypothesizes that the greater the technological sophistication of the industry, the more positive the relationship between pioneering orientation and firm growth. hierarchical regression analysis was utilized to examine the hypotheses as observed within a grouping of 101 select firms. findings indicate that all hypotheses are supported, except for that regarding strategic learning, which is shown to negatively moderate the relationship between pioneering orientation and firm growth. the authors conclude with a discussion of the findings and the potential implications of the study.",0
"the authors explore to what extent there is persistence in, and interrelation between, alliance strategies with different partner types (customers, suppliers, competitors). in a panel data set of innovation-active firms in the netherlands from 1996 to 2004, the authors find persistence in alliance strategies with all three types of partners, but customer alliance strategies are more persistent than supplier alliance strategies and competitor alliance strategies. a positive interrelation between customer and supplier alliance strategies and a high persistence of joint supplier and customer alliance strategies are consistent with the advantages of value chain integration in innovation efforts. prior engagement in horizontal (competitor) alliances increases the propensity to engage in vertical alliance strategies, but this effect occurs only with a longer lag. overall, the authors' findings suggest that alliance strategies with different partner types are both heterogeneous in persistence and (temporally) interrelated. this suggests that intertemporal relationships between different types of alliances may be as important as their simultaneous relationship in alliance portfolios.",1
"this paper studies the impact of debt relief, using a natural experiment arising from india's ""agricultural debt waiver and debt relief scheme,"" one of the largest household-level debt relief initiatives in history. i find that debt relief has a substantial impact on household balance sheets, but does not affect savings, consumption and investment, as predicted by theories of debt overhang or balance sheet distress. instead, debt relief leads to greater reliance on informal credit, reduced investment, and lower agricultural productivity. consistent with moral hazard generated by the bailout, beneficiaries are significantly less concerned about the reputational consequences of future default.",1
"evidence suggests that excise taxes on tobacco improve fetal health. however, it remains unknown if smoke exposure in early life causes lasting harm to children. i find that in utero exposure to a dollar increase in the state cigarette tax causes a 10 percent decrease in sick days from school and a 4.7 percent decrease in having two or more doctor visits. i present additional evidence for decreases in hospitalizations and asthma. this supports the hypothesis that exposure to cigarette smoke in utero and infancy carries significant medium-term costs, and that excise taxes can lead to lasting inter-generational improvements in well-being.",0
"many developed countries have recently experienced sharp increases in home birth rates. this paper investigates the impact of home births on the health of low-risk newborns using data from the netherlands, the only developed country where home births are widespread. to account for endogeneity in location of birth, we exploit the exogenous variation in distance from a mother's residence to the closest hospital. we find that giving birth in a hospital leads to substantial reductions in newborn mortality. we provide suggestive evidence that proximity to medical technologies may be an important channel contributing to these health gains.",1
"this paper provides new evidence on the long-term benefits of head start using the national longitudinal survey of youth. i compare siblings who differ in their participation in the program, controlling for a variety of pre-treatment covariates. i estimate that head start participants gain 0.23 standard deviations on a summary index of young adult outcomes. this closes one-third of the gap between children with median and bottom quartile family income, and is about 80 percent as large as model programs such as perry preschool. the long-term impact for disadvantaged children is large despite ""fade-out"" of test score gains.

"suicide prevention efforts have not slowed suicide rates, in part because of limited understanding of differences in risk for suicide ideation versus suicide attempts. reduced fear of pain and death may be key to this distinction. in the present study we examine whether blunted neural response to threat of death, bodily harm, or illness, measured by the late positive potential (lpp), differentiates individuals who had previously attempted suicide from individuals who had never attempted suicide, controlling for current levels of suicidal ideation. we compared psychiatric outpatients with no history of suicide attempts (n = 152) and those with a history of suicide attempts (n = 83). attempters exhibited a blunted threat-elicited lpp compared to patients with no history of attempts, regardless of current ideation. findings suggest diminished neural response to threat can distinguish attempters from ideators and might be a target for future research on the transition from ideation to action.",0
"cognitive theories of recurrent depression suggest that the relationship between mood and cognition is altered by previous depressive episodes. in individuals remitted from depression (rmd) this would be linked to a larger susceptibility for new depressive symptoms. this study explored whether the association between mood and rumination indeed is different between rmd and nondepressed controls relying on dynamic systems theory (dst). from dst we selected entropy, defined here as the level of unpredictability in the relation between mood and rumination, as the main variable of interest. daily electronic dairy measures of mood and rumination were administered in 31 rmd patients and 32 healthy controls. the results indicate that mean levels of rumination and negative mood were elevated in rmd compared with controls. at the group level, entropy did not differ significantly and entropy was also not associated with the number of episodes. however, entropy predicted depressive symptoms in the rmd group and the brooding subtype of rumination in both groups at the 6-month follow-up. these data are specific for entropy and were not obtained using mean levels of momentary mood and rumination.",0
"we examine ""reaching for yield"" in u.s. corporate bond mutual funds. we define reaching for yield as tilting portfolios toward bonds with yields higher than the benchmarks. we find that funds generate higher returns and attract more inflows when they reach for yield, especially in periods of low-interest rates. returns for high reaching-for-yield funds nevertheless tend to be negative on a risk-adjusted basis. funds engage in rank-chasing behavior by reaching for yield, although these incentives are moderated by the illiquid nature of corporate bonds. high reaching-for-yield funds hold less cash and less liquid bonds, exacerbating redemption risks.",1
"we develop a 10-k-based multidimensional measure of firm locations. using this measure, we show that firm-level information is geographically distributed and institutional investors are able to exploit the resulting information asymmetry. specifically, institutional investors overweigh firms whose 10-k frequently mentions the investors' state even when those firms are not headquartered locally and earn superior returns on those stocks. these ownership and performance patterns are stronger among hard-to-value firms. local investor performance increases with the degree of local bias and with the local economic exposure of portfolio firms. overall, geographical variation in firm-level information generates economically significant location-based information asymmetry.",1
"previous studies report that cash holdings are more valuable for financially constrained firms than for unconstrained firms. we examine (i) why this is so and (ii) why some constrained firms appear to hold too little cash. our results indicate that greater cash holdings are associated with higher levels of investment for constrained firms with high hedging needs and that the association between investment and value is stronger for constrained firms than for unconstrained firms. these findings imply that higher cash holdings allow constrained firms to undertake value-increasing projects that might otherwise be bypassed. we further find that some constrained firms exhibit low cash holdings because of persistently low cash flows. overall, our findings support the view that greater cash holdings of constrained firms are a value-increasing response to costly external financing.",0
"this research explores the implications of nonprofit leaders' government ties for nonprofit operations and functions. based on 81 survey questionnaires completed by civic environmental ngos (engos) in china and interviews with executives from 33 engos, the authors examine the personal backgrounds of engo leaders and find that most chinese civic engos are connected with the government in one or more of three ways: political ties, service organization ties, or personal ties. personal ties, or good guanxi with government officials, are positively associated with a higher level of funding stability and a more developed management system. environmental ngos with leaders who are current government officials or legislative body members are more likely to be engaged in policy advocacy. service organization ties facilitate engos' efforts to be engaged in legal services and to scale up to work on environmental issues at the national level. moreover, an engo's policy advocacy engagement is associated with its ties with the nonprofit community.",0
"collaborative partnerships can be an effective strategy for crime prevention, especially in disorganized communities. using ordinary least squares regression with 414 american cities, this article finds that police departments with many collaborative partnerships are able to promote informal social control within their communities and capitalize on the resources available to them with the help of other groups. this contention is supported by the effects of collaborative partnerships on crime rates in disorganized communities in comparison to well-organized communities. thus, collaborative partnerships of public organizations with other groups may insulate disorganized communities from the effects of community disorganization on levels of crime.",0
"entrepreneurial ventures often face liquidity constraints. while governments have intervened with programs subsidizing research and development (r&d) projects, these programs may have their effectiveness undermined by the restrictions they impose on subsidy recipients. we study the impact on venture outcomes of one important restriction, namely, the prohibition on transferring know-how away from a given geographic area. using novel data on israeli start-ups and evaluating a policy change that relaxed this restriction, we find that the policy change increased the likelihood of applying for a subsidy for start-ups most likely to have been affected by the restriction. we also show that r&d subsidies had a significant positive effect on start-up survival, the ability to attract external investment, and innovation, but only for recipients applying for subsidies after the restriction was relaxed.",0
"we explore the overlooked issue of how certain strategic-level, interindustry diversification options might increase consumer utility. discussions of inter-industry diversification typically focus on producer synergies obtainable from economies of scope or from skill transfer across business units. discussions of intra-industry product diversification-generally, the province of marketing typically focus on synergies obtainable from product bundling, which lowers producer costs or provides convenience for consumers. we take a different tack by linking interindustry diversification and consumer utility. we first separately examine two possible consumer benefits of interindustry diversification: (1) facilitating consumers' accomplishment of two tasks simultaneously or (2) attracting diverse consumer groups to a common platform when intergroup externalities exist. we then assess a simple empirical context that shows potential for simultaneous consumer utilities and two-sided market utility together. we analyze this context and concurrently develop a mathematical model showing how these demand-side synergies can create unique business value. we next introduce asymmetric preferences among consumer subgroups, and we refine our arguments by comparing their conclusions with the empirical data. we learn that combinations of otherwise mundane (i.e., commonplace) assets can create consumer value-""superior"" assets are not necessary. moreover, common ownership is necessary for the pricing flexibility required to deliver (and capture) maximum value through interindustry diversification, especially when consumer groups' preferences may change; the negotiations. and settling up required for cooperation through alliances will, without common ownership, increase costs and reduce responsiveness. we discuss the sustainability of demand-side advantages and the implications of these ideas for future research and practice.",0
"this paper investigates the effects of organizational form on problemistic search. we contrast how indian. firms affiliated with business groups and unaffiliated. firms evaluate performance and react by adjusting their internal technology search and external market search. we propose that, compared with unaffiliated. firms, business group-affiliated (bg-affiliated) firms are more externally oriented in setting aspiration levels and more likely to respond to low performance in the market domain. we. find support for an external orientation of bg-affiliated. firms and. find that group affiliation determines the responsiveness to performance feedback in different search domains. the. findings suggest a need to add considerations of organizational form and governance to the theory of organizational search.",0
"significant ambiguity remains in the literature regarding the conceptualization of organizational ambidexterity. we unpack this construct into one with two dimensions we term the balance dimension of ambidexterity (bd) and the combined dimension of ambidexterity (cd). bd corresponds to a firm's orientation to maintain a close relative balance between exploratory and exploitative activities, whereas cd corresponds to their combined magnitude. we reason that these dimensions are conceptually distinct, and rely on different causal mechanisms to enhance firm performance. we find that over and above their independent effects, concurrent high levels of bd and cd yield synergistic benefits. we also find that bd is more beneficial to resource-constrained firms, whereas cd is more beneficial to firms having greater access to internal and/or external resources. these results indicate that managers in resource-constrained contexts may benefit from a focus on managing trade-offs between exploration and exploitation demands, but for firms that have access to sufficient resources, the simultaneous pursuit of exploration and exploitation is both possible and desirable.",0
"as individuals change jobs more frequently, it is increasingly important to understand what they carry from their prior work experience that affects their performance in a new organizational context. so far, explanations about the imperfect portability of experience have primarily been about firm specificity of knowledge and skill. we draw on psychological theory to propose additional sociocognitive factors that interfere with the transfer of knowledge and skill acquired from prior related work experience. as we hypothesized, we find that task-relevant knowledge and skill mediates the relationship between prior related experience and job performance and that it acts as suppressing mediator of a negative direct relationship between prior related experience and current job performance. we also find that the positive effect of prior related experience on task-relevant knowledge and skill is attenuated by higher levels of experience within the current firm.",0
