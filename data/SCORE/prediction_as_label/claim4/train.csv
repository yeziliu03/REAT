"There was a main effect of delay type, with greater accuracy in children who slept after training (M = 70%, SE = 0.07) than in those who stayed awake (M = 50%, SE = 0.04), F(1, 35) = 5.63, p = .02, partial eta squared = .14, Cohen’s d = .80",1
"The developmental analysis indicated that the number of children who passed increased significantly with age in the ASYNC 366 test trials, chi squared (4, N = 60) = 12.8, p < .01",1
"At posttest (May, Grade 1), the CARRI group was on a higher level than the RRI group, t(48) = 2.10, p ≤ .041, Cohen's d = .90",1
"As predicted, the factors that remained significant in the final model were those related to race salience and essentialist thinking, including the 'sorting by race' measure, (beta =.34, p = .003) ",1

"Across different samples and using...Patent Index...as a measure of innovation output, the paper shows that firms with higher innovation output are more likely to become acquirers. In Table III, Panel A, [the coefficient for “Patent Index” is 0.273, significant at the 1% level.]",1
"Overall language ability in English as measured on the SLAS was significantly, positively correlated with overall performance on immediate comprehension (r = .34, p < .01). Thus, children with higher scores on the SLAS, which indicates overall English language ability, tended to have higher scores on the immediate comprehension task.",1
"Significant between-group differences were found in achievement: Group 3 showed the highest achievement, followed by Group 2 and Group 1 (from Table 5, means for 'Grades': Group 2 [Father Low] = 69.90_b; Group 3 [Moderately autonomy-supportive] = 73.81_c; Different subscripts indicate significant differences at p < .05 on post hoc comparisons using Tukey HSD.).",1
"Task-focused behavior – when measured in grade 2 – continued to predict uniquely spelling (4%, p < .05) in grade 3, even when the authors controlled for the effects of the autoregressor.",1
"Holding all else constant, TFA teachers are 55% less at risk of moving schools during the year compared to traditionally prepared teachers, relative risk ratio = 0.45, p < 0.001",1
"The results of the simple linear regression analyses for African American students were significant in that the number of TPD teachers a student had predicted his or her eighth-grade mathe-matics EOG scores, b = .14, t(1010) = 8.00, p < .001. That is, with each additional TPD teacher a student had, his or her mathematics EOG score increased by 0.14 levels",1
"Students eligible for FRL (estimate = 11.99) are more likely to be assigned to a teacher with low prior-year value added than are advantaged students (those not receiving FRL, estimate = 8.14), difference = 3.85, p < 0.05, two sided",1
"The Hispanic–White gap was .20 SD narrower in Grade 8 than in Grade 3 (Table 2, column 4, delta b = 0.199, p < 0.001)",1
"The regression also presents evidence that points takers are more likely to be less sophisticated than other borrowers. The regressions show that borrowers who have a bachelor’s degree or higher are less likely to buy points and older borrowers (above age 65) are more likely to take points. [coefficient for “College/grad dummy” is -0.004, statistically significant at the 1% level.] Standard errors are clustered by calendar month. [t-statistic is -4.81.]",1
"Participants observing the chef throughout the process perceived more effort than did participants who did not see the chef (t(161) = 3.89, p < 0.01)",1
These results indicate that the stock returns of firms that have the highest inventory performance tend to exceed the stock returns of firms that have the lowest inventory performance. From Table 4: t statistic for “inventory turnover” = 4.92,1
"The focal contrast explained a significant amount of variance in the model (delta R^2 = .05), F(1, 114) = 8.74, p = .004.",0
"The second-step neighbourhood-level regressions confirm [first-step] findings controlling for all other individual and neighbourhood characteristics (Table 2, 'Moving-in immigrant vs. native -- Model 2,' '%Immigrant' variable: estimate = 6.680; robust SE = 1.048; P < 0.01).",1
