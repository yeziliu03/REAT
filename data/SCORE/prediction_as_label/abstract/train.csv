"we present a data-driven model of stereotypes about occupations (total n = 3919). across two classification systems and national contexts (u.s.; germany), we show remarkable convergence in the stereotype dimensions spontaneously employed to make sense of occupational groups (agency; progressiveness). further studies show that these dimensions reflect presumed characteristics of job holders and not just describe their occupational role (study 2), and that proximity of occupations on the emerging stereotype model increased superordinate categorization (study 3) and contagious transfer of (positive and negative) valence from one occupation to another (study 4). together these studies do not only provide important insights into the perception of one of the most ubiquitous social taxonomies but also provide a rich, open access dataset for researchers seeking to employ occupational groups as a tool to better understand stereotypes and intergroup relations in general.",0
"the ability to infer the psychological forces that drive others' behaviour is a cornerstone of human cognition. this 'theory of mind' (tom) we have has been extensively studied in its developmental stages and non-human forms. however, how the fully developed theory of mind functions on a daily basis is still the focus of ongoing research. one capacity stemming from theory of mind involves overt linguistic mental state reference. we propose that, rather than being a capacity that those with a fully developed tom use consistently, mental state reference is a function of our social relationship to others: specifically, whether the other is perceived as an ingroup or out-group member. we therefore examined spontaneous mental state reference during casual conversation as a function of group membership. participants were divided into 'in-group' or 'out-group' pairs using a classic minimal group paradigm. next, they were allowed to converse casually with their partner without the experimenter present and then subsequently asked to describe their partner in a written format after interactions. we scored participants' conversations and their written descriptions of each other for frequency and complexity of mental state reference. results showed that, when interacting with presumed out-group members, participants referenced their partners' mental states significantly less often than when interacting with presumed in-group members. this effect was found both during conversations and in subsequent descriptions of the partner. spontaneous mental state reference is apparently not a consistent psychological process but instead subject to social constructs, specifically group membership.",0
"in this study, we used a mouse-tracking paradigm to capture subtle processing dynamics that may occur when people spontaneously endorse or disavow political conspiracies. rather than exclusively focus on explicit, endpoint responses, we examined the underlying temptation to respond opposite of what is overtly reported. our results revealed such tendencies in participants' arm movements as they provided ""true"" or ""false"" answers to political conspiracy statements relative to baseline statements. these effects were strongly modulated by whether participants identified with the republican or democratic parties. to interpret our findings, we argue that political conspiracies tap into hidden biases that may be at odds with each other, such that, even for nonbelievers of a particular conspiracy, there is an implicit appeal for ideologically-aligned conspiracies driven by motivated reasoning biases, and for believers, an implicit aversion to the same conspiracies driven by accuracy and self presentation needs.",0
"past research has consistently demonstrated that creating a sense of a common ingroup identity can be beneficial for reducing intergroup tensions and creating intergroup harmony. at the same time, however, creating a strong sense of a common ingroup identity has elements that may undermine disadvantaged-group members' motivation for collective action toward social change. in the present paper, we report two experiments that investigated how, compared to salient separate ethnic/racial identities, increasing the salience of a common us identity among blacks and latinos results in lower collective action intentions. these effects were mediated by a reduction in group-based anger and group-efficacy beliefs, and, in experiment 2, reduced recognition of group based inequality in society as well. increasing salience of common ingroup and separate group identities,simultaneously (a dual identity), however, did not decrease collective action intentions. these results suggest that not recategorization in itself, but an exclusive focus on common ingroup identity undermines motivation for social change.

"when negative events occur (e.g., a breakup, a mass shooting), people naturally ask themselves why such things happen. recent research has shown that more abstract thinking about negative events fosters less uncertainty about why those events happened. the present research examined a downstream consequence of this effect, namely, whether causal uncertainty activates a goal to think more abstractly. we drew on principles of goal activation, to show that after leading participants to feel more uncertain about a negative event, they were more likely to resume an experience that afforded an opportunity to think more abstractly ( i.e., focusing on similarities rather than differences; experiments 1a and 1b). in further support of our motivational framework, we also show that after leading participants to feel more uncertain about a negative event, they no longer exhibited a more positive attitude toward an experience that afforded an opportunity to think more abstractly once they had the opportunity to actually engage in more abstract thinldng (experiment 2). theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

"the ability of attitudinal ambivalence and certainty to individually predict an attitude's stability over time has received mixed support. we proposed that ambivalence and certainty moderate one another's relationship with temporal attitude stability. that is, we hypothesized an interaction between these two attitude strength variables to predict stability over time. in three studies, we used two-stage designs in which attitudes were assessed twice with an interval ranging from one to twelve months between measurements. across these longitudinal studies examining different attitude objects, greater certainty was associated with greater stability across different time points as ambivalence decreased, and greater ambivalence was associated with greater instability as attitude certainty increased. notably, the results held across-health-related, social, and real-world political topics.

"self-esteem fluctuates in response to verbal feedback and social exclusion, but such unambiguous feedback may not occur frequently enough to account for moment-to-moment self-esteem fluctuations. we propose that others' facial behavior provides a frequently-encountered source of feedback to which self-esteem should respond. we expected repeated exposure to angry faces to reduce perceivers' self-esteem but only when those faces exhibited direct-gaze (""looked at"" perceivers). two studies supported this hypothesis. in study 1, participants viewed a series of faces under the guise of a memory paradigm. self-esteem was reduced among participants who viewed angry faces compared to participants who viewed neutral or happy faces. crucially, this pattern only occurred in response to faces exhibiting direct-gaze. in study 2, participants completed a word-identification task in which attention to faces was task-irrelevant. the results of this study replicated study 1 but only to the extent faces captured participants' attention during the priming task.

"anthropomorphism in impressions of animals is commonplace, and this generalization from humans to animals is one example of a broader tendency to generalize from adaptively significant categories when judging specific exemplars. although anthropomorphism may lead to unlikely or incorrect judgments, it fostered accurate sex-differentiation of macaque faces due to an appropriate generalization from the sexually dimorphic cues that distinguish human male and female faces to macaques. as predicted, koreans performed better than caucasians in sex-differentiating macaque faces, a difference mediated by koreans' greater use of sexually dimorphic eye height cues. these results extend and disambiguate evidence of east asian superiority in sex-differentiating human faces. whereas an own-race advantage might explain the previous but not the present findings, both can be explained by east asians' keener sensitivity to sexually dimorphic cues, perhaps owing to the greater subtlety of such cues in east asian faces. implications of this sensitivity for other cultural differences in person perception are discussed.

"schematic influences of rape myth acceptance (rma) on visual information processing were studied. after reading a short text on a rape case, students viewed a ""police photograph"" of the plaintiff's living room, where the rape allegedly happened, while their eye-movements were recorded. the photograph contained two myth-consistent cues, one being expected in the situation (wine bottle and glasses), the other unexpected (poster of a nude male). results of study 1 (n=60) showed that participants higher in rma fixated the expected cue both earlier and less long, which may indicate hypervigilance and greater ease of processing, respectively. higher rma also predicted longer initial fixation of the unexpected cue. these processing differences mediated participants' verdicts and blame judgments. in study 2 (n=30), participants level of rma was manipulated experimentally via social norm feedback. this manipulation significantly affected eye-movement patterns for the expected myth-consistent cue. results support the notion that rma actively guides visual information processing of relevant stimuli.

"one of the most replicable findings reported in the social psychological literature is the cross-race memory effect. we argue this effect derives from higher-order interactions among social cues that determine the perceived relevance of a face to an observer the current research tested this hypothesis by examining the combined influences of eye gaze direction and race on face memory the physical subtlety of eye gaze belies its powerful influence on social perception, and in this case helps specify the relevance of same-versus other-race faces we found that only in faces making direct eye contact-nor those displaying averted eye gaze-was the cross-race memory effect evident likewise, only in same-race faces did direct relative to averted-gaze enhance face memory. these findings have implications for our general understanding of the combinatorial nature of social perception and help clarify the underlying cause of the cross-race memory effect (c) 2010 elsevier inc all rights reserved",0
"the current research investigated the role of spontaneous partner feelings (implicit partner affect) in the dynamics of relationship satisfaction, commitment, and romantic dissolution. participants completed a variant of the name-letter task as a measure of implicit partner affect, and self-report measures of relationship satisfaction and commitment. approximately 4 months later, participants were contacted to assess their current relationship status. overall, participants showed a biased preference for their partner's initials (after adjusting for proper baselines), indicating the presence of positive implicit partner affect. participants with more positive implicit partner affect were more satisfied with, but not more committed to, their relationship. additionally, implicit partner affect exerted a significant indirect effect on relationship stability. these effects were independent of relationship length, age, and gender. implications for the role of automatic affective processes in relationship processes and the utility of indirect measures for shedding light on relationship dynamics are discussed.

"prior research has shown that race influences perceptions of facial expressions, with hostility detected earlier on young male black than white faces. this study examined whether the interplay of race and age would moderate perceptions of hostility by having participants evaluate facial expressions of multiply-categorizable targets. using a facial emotion change-detection task, we assessed evaluations of onset/offset of anger and happiness on faces of young and old black and white men. significant age by race interactions were observed: while participants perceived anger as lasting longer and appearing sooner on old compared to young white faces, this relationship was reversed for black faces, with participants perceiving anger lasting longer and appearing sooner on young compared to old black faces. similar results were found for perceived happiness. these results suggest that perception during cross-categorization may be more complex than the simple additive function proposed by the double-jeopardy hypothesis, such that co-activation of other stereotypes may sometimes confer a protective benefit against bias.

"though perceived financial well-being is viewed as an important topic of consumer research, the literature contains no accepted definition of this construct. further, there has been little systematic examination of how perceived financial well-being may affect overall well-being. using consumer financial narratives, several large-scale surveys, and two experiments, we conceptualize perceived financial wellbeing as two related but separate constructs: 1) stress related to the management of money today (current money management stress), and 2) a sense of security in one's financial future (expected future financial security). we develop and validate measures of these constructs (web appendix a) and then demonstrate their relationship to overall well-being, controlling for other life domains and objective measures of the financial domain. our findings demonstrate that perceived financial well-being is a key predictor of overall well-being and comparable in magnitude to the combined effect of other life domains (job satisfaction, physical health assessment, and relationship support satisfaction). further, the relative importance of current money management stress to overall well-being varies by income groups and due to the differing antecedents of current money management stress and expected future financial security. implications for financial well-being and education efforts are offered.",0
"research in political psychology indicates that liberals are less motivated than conservatives by epistemic, existential, and relational needs to reduce uncertainty, threat, and social discord, and are therefore more prone to challenge the status quo. in a compelling extension of this work into the field of consumer behavior, jung, garbarino, briley, and wynhausen (this issue) demonstrate that people residing in more liberal (vs. conservative) areas register more complaints with the us consumer financial protection bureau, federal communications commission, and national highway traffic safety administration, and dispute more resolutions offered in response to their complaints. furthermore, liberals were found to object more strongly to the hypothetical imposition of an unanticipated banking fee, and this effect was mediated by system justification. inspired by jung and colleagues, we investigated the hypothesis that liberals would also be more likely to buy and boycott consumer products for political reasons. we analyzed data from the american national election studies and european social surveys and discovered that, even after we adjusted for demographic factors, liberals in the united states and leftists in all 15 european countries were more likely than conservatives and rightists to report having bought a product-or refrained from buying a product-for political reasons.",0
"marketing strategies are often tied to how consumers spend time (e.g., waiting in lines, searching across stores) in return for money (e.g., receiving a discount). viewing such time-money tradeoffs in terms of a reservation wage rate for consumers, we identify a wage-rate asymmetry between two elicitation procedures: (a) money-elicit (mel): state the minimum amount of money, m, that you would accept in return for spending a given number of hours, t; and (b) time-elicit (tel): state the maximum number of hours, t, that you would spend in return for accepting a given amount of money, m. while these procedures are normatively equivalent, we propose that tel (vs. mel) wage rates are higher because time scarcity receives a higher weight in tel judgments. in eight studies including both hypothetical and real settings, we document the wage-rate asymmetry, the time scarcity process, and a downstream consequence of tel (vs. mel) reducing the likelihood of accepting a time-money tradeoff. we discuss the implications for practice, and for research on wage rates, time versus money, procedural invariance, and scarcity.",0
"previous research has shown that material goods can help people self-express, either because the products are themselves self-expressive (e.g., a band t-shirt) or because the products are associated with a desired group. this article examines a new signal of self-expressiveness: whether the product is polarizing-that is, whether some people strongly like the product and other people strongly dislike the product. eight studies examine how polarization and its associated indicator in the online domain (a bimodal distribution of user star ratings) affects consumer preferences. the results indicate that polarizing products are perceived to be more self-expressive and to serve as stronger indicators of one's tastes and personality. as a result, people find products with bimodal rating distributions to be more desirable when they experience temporary or chronic low self-concept clarity. further, people evaluate products with bimodal distributions more favorably in consumption contexts in which self-expression is important. these effects emerge when the bimodal distribution pertains to a self-expressive attribute (e.g., style) but not when it pertains to a non-self-expressive attribute (e.g., quality). last, the effect is especially strong when people have the motivation to express an individual-rather than group-level identity. hence, polarizing products are seen as vehicles for individual self-expression.",0
"despite the prevalence of single-serve and multi-serve package formats in the pharmaceutical and functional food and beverage industries, prior research has yet to explore the effects of such package formats on consumers' perceptions of product efficacy. building on the resource availability, product packaging, and psychological closure literature, the authors demonstrate across seven studies that when processing capacity is low, consuming a particular serving/dosage of a product from a smaller resource inventory (i.e., the entirety of a single-serve package) may subjectively feel more adequate than consuming the same amount from a larger resource inventory (i.e., a multi-serve package, namely one in which additional servings/doses remain after consumption). results indicate that differences in felt consumption closure underlie perceptions of product adequacy. importantly, perceived product adequacy is shown to affect consumers' actual product efficacy experiences (i.e., task performance), expectancies, and judgments. the implications of this research for marketers, consumers, and the public health community are discussed.",0
"this research introduces the concept of material parenting, in which parents use material goods to express their love or to shape children's behavior. despite the common use of material goods for these purposes, possible long term effects of material parenting practices have not been studied. this article addresses this oversight by examining the potential effects of material parenting on the material values of children once they're grown. this research proposes and tests a material parenting pathway, in which warm and supportive parents provide children with material rewards that in the long run foster materialism in adulthood. an insecurity pathway to materialism, previously proposed in the literature, is also examined. results from three survey studies provide support for both pathways. results also suggest that material parenting may influence children's material values by (possibly unintentionally) encouraging them to use possessions to shape and transform the self.",0
"affect toward countries can be generated by people's personal experiences with the country or by targeted advertising campaigns designed to create positive affect toward the country. in four experiments, this research examines the effect of country-related affect (cra) on the evaluations of products originating from the country. country-related affect (cra) systematically influences product evaluations depending on the valence as well as the warmth or competence associations of cra. positive cra enhances evaluations of products with favorable country-related product (crp) associations, but it boomerangs and decreases evaluations of products with unfavorable crp associations. positive cra engenders high (vs. low) construal processing that directs consumer attention to crp associations under low (vs. high) arousal conditions (experiments 1 and 2). experiments 3 and 4 establish that cra is a unique type of incidental affect that influences product evaluations based on its warmth or competence associations. the implications for country of origin research are discussed.",0
"this research examines the effects of social exclusion on a critical aspect of consumer behavior, financial decision-making. specifically, four lab experiments and one field survey uncover how feeling isolated or ostracized causes consumers to pursue riskier but potentially more profitable financial opportunities. these daring proclivities do not appear driven by impaired affect or self-esteem. rather, interpersonal rejection exacerbates financial risk-taking by heightening the instrumentality of money (as a substitute for popularity) to obtain benefits in life. invariably, the quest for wealth that ensues tends to adopt a riskier but potentially more lucrative road. the article concludes by discussing the implications of its findings for behavioral research as well as for societal and individual welfare.",0
"despite the challenged contention that consumers serve more onto larger dinnerware, it remains unclear what would cause this and who might be most at risk. the results of five studies suggest that the neglected delboeuf illusion may explain how the size of dinnerware creates two opposing biases that lead people to overserve on larger plates and bowls and underserve on smaller ones. a countercyclical sinus-shaped relationship is shown to exist between these serving biases and the relative gap between the edge of the food and the edge of the dinnerware. although these serving biases are difficult to eliminate with attention and education, changing the color of one's dinnerware or tablecloth may help attenuate them. by showing that the delboeuf illusion offers a mechanistic explanation for how dinnerware size can bias serving and intake, we open new theoretical opportunities for linking illusions to eating behavior and suggest how simple changes in design can improve consumer welfare.",0
"are romance movies more desirable when people are cold? building on research on (bodily) feeling-as-information and embodied cognition, we hypothesize that physical coldness activates a need for psychological warmth, which in turn leads to an increased liking for romance movies. four laboratory experiments and an analysis of online movie rental data provide support for our hypothesis. specifically, studies 1a and 1b show that physical coldness increases the liking of and willingness to pay for romance movies. study 2 shows that the effect of physical coldness on liking of romance movies only occurs for people who associate romance movies with psychological warmth. study 3 shows that people correct for the influence of physical coldness on their liking of romance movies when physical coldness is made salient. in study 4, using data on online movie rentals and historical temperature, we found a negative relationship between weather temperature and preference for romance movies.",0
"neurobiological theories of affective processing suggest that different affective states can make people more sensitive to the stimulation impinging on different sensory channels. five experiments show that consumers in a negative affective state experience enhanced sensitivity to the tactile benefits of products, whereas consumers in a positive affective state experience enhanced sensitivity to the visual benefits of products. affect-based sensory sensitivity is a consequence of adaptations that induce mammals to seek social support when in a negative affective state and explore the environment when in a positive affective state. in humans, these adaptations are part of an innate system that influences preferences for products with tactile or visual benefits.",0
"consumers often gauge their own and others' preferences for products through social comparisons. this research examines the role of consumers' need for uniqueness (cnfu) in two common social comparisons: projection and introjection. consumers project (i.e., rely on their own preferences to estimate those of others), regardless of their cnfu. however, high-cnfu consumers are less likely than low-cnfu ones to introject (i.e., rely on estimates of others' preferences to gauge their own). moreover, alleviating the introjection-induced threat to the high-cnfu consumers' self-concept by having them deliberate on their differentness from others increases their likelihood of introjection. together, these findings confirm our basic contention that the process underlying introjection is more motivational in nature than that underlying projection.",0
"because consumers ask different questions to establish commitment at beginning versus advanced stages of goal pursuit, we propose that progress that they attribute to themselves and to the situation will have a distinctive impact on motivation, depending on their relative position in goal pursuit. when progress on achieving a goal is low, people are concerned about its attainability. because attributing low progress to self (vs. to the situation) signals a higher difficulty of goal attainment, it leads to lower goal commitment and, subsequently, decreased motivation. conversely, when progress on achieving the goal is high and attainment of the goal is relatively secured, people are more concerned about the value of the goal. because attributing a high progress to self (vs. to the situation) signals a greater value of the goal, it should lead to greater goal commitment and, subsequently, higher motivation.",0
"we propose that when predicting future behavior, consumers selectively (but unwittingly) test the hypothesis that they will behave ideally. this selective hypothesis testing perspective on unrealistic optimism suggests that estimates of future behavior should be similar to those made by individuals who assume that conditions will be ideal. moreover, consumers who initially provide estimates assuming that conditions will be ideal should recognize that the world is not ideal and so should test a more realistic hypothesis. in line with these predictions, we find that ideal-world estimates (e. g., in an ideal world, how often will you exercise next week?) do not differ from standard estimates (e. g., how often will you exercise next week?). we also find that individuals who initially estimate their behavior in an ideal world subsequently make more realistic predictions.",0
"we investigated whether watching a videotaped photo array administration or expert testimony could sensitize jurors to the suggestiveness of single-blind eyewitness identification procedures. mock jurors recruited from the community (n = 231) watched a videotaped simulation of a robbery trial in which the primary evidence against the defendant was an eyewitness identification. we varied whether the witness made an identification from a single-or double-blind photo array, the evidence included a videotape of the photo array procedure, and an expert testified about the effects of single-blind identification procedures on administrators' behaviors and witness accuracy. watching the videotaped photo array administration sensitized mock jurors to the suggestiveness of the single-blind procedure, causing them to be less likely to convict a defendant identified through single-rather than double-blind procedures. exposure to the videotaped procedure also decreased the favorability of mock jurors' ratings of the eyewitness, irrespective of whether the lineup was conducted by a single-blind administrator. expert testimony did not sensitize jurors to administrator bias. thus, videotaping identification procedures could serve as an important procedural reform that both preserves a record of whether the lineup administration was suggestive and might improve jurors' evaluations of eyewitness evidence.",0
"two experiments were conducted to see if asking witnesses to take another look at the lineup after they voiced their identification decisions would alter their choices, and if confirming feedback could then be used to solidify the selections they shifted to. participants watched a simulated crime and were asked to identify the culprit from a photographic lineup. after voicing their identification decisions participants were prompted to re-examine the lineup. half ot the participants then received confirming feedback for their decisions, regardless of whether they shifted to a new picture or not. later on, a different experimenter escorted participants to a second room and administered the same lineup again. in experiment 1 (n = 432), biased instructions were used to encourage choosing, and when participants were prompted to re-examine the lineup 70% changed their identification decisions and selected a different picture when that new selection was reinforced with feedback and participants weie given a second opportunity to identify the culprit at a later time, 72% selected the picture they shifted to as the culprit. participants who made their decisions more quickly were less likely to shift, but accuracy did not predict shifting. this general pattern of findings was replicated using unbiased instructions in experiment 2 (n = 237). results suggest that prompting witnesses to re-examine the lineup can often lead witnesses to change then identification decisions, and when the altered choice is rienforced, they will often stay with that influenced decision over time, asserting it with a high degree of confidence.",0
"most suspects waive the guaranteed protections that interrogation rights afford them against police intimidation. one factor thought to motivate suspects' inclination to waive their rights stems from the acquiescence bias whereby suspects mindlessly comply with interrogators' requests. however, research bearing on the phenomenology of innocence has demonstrated the power of innocents' mindset, which could motivate some innocent suspects to waive their rights knowingly (instead of mindlessly complying). to test these ideas, participants (n = 178) were (a) rightfully (guilty) or wrongfully (innocent) accused of wrongdoing during an experimental session, (b) administered 1 of 2 forms that by signing either waived or invoked their rights to a student advocate, and (c) given questions to assess their degree of knowing during the decision-making process (i.e., extent to which individuals were cognizant of their decisions). results demonstrated that unknowing innocent and guilty individuals tended to passively comply, engaging in a pre-interrogation acquiescence bias by signing waive and invoke forms at similar rates. but, as participants became more cognizant of their decisions, they acquiesced at lower rates and their change from acquiescence differed depending on their status. as innocents became more cognizant, they signed the waiver form at higher rates than the invoke form, thereby demonstrating that innocence can motivate some suspects to knowingly forgo their rights. conversely, as guilty individuals became more cognizant, they signed the invoke form at higher rates than the waiver form. these findings have implications for reforming pre-interrogation protocols, protecting suspects' civil liberties, and preventing innocents from offering false self-incriminating evidence. public significance statement innocent and guilty people uniquely approach the decision to forgo their miranda rights. all people who do not understand the decision process passively comply with interrogators' requests and forgo their rights, but guilty people with better understanding exercise their rights regardless of interrogators' requests. problematically, innocents with better understanding forgo their rights regardless of interrogators' requests-suggesting that miranda rights, as currently administered, serve an opposite purpose than originally intended.",0
"this research examines how the cultural dimension of uncertainty avoidance-a person's (in) tolerance for uncertain or unknown situations-impacts communication alignment in crisis negotiations. we hypothesized that perpetrators high on uncertainty avoidance would respond better to negotiators who use formal language and legitimize their position with reference to law, procedures, and moral codes. data were transcriptions of 53 negotiations from a dutch-german police training initiative, where police negotiators interacted with a high (german) and low (dutch) uncertainty-avoidant mock perpetrator. consistent with accounts of cross-cultural interaction, negotiators tended to achieve more alignment in within-culture interactions compared to cross-cultural interactions. moreover, german negotiators, who scored higher on uncertainty avoidance than the dutch negotiators, were found to use more legitimizing messages and more formal language than their dutch counterparts. critically, irrespective of the negotiators cultural background, the use of these behaviors was a significant moderator of the degree to which negotiator and perpetrator aligned their communicative frames: using legitimizing and formal language helped with german perpetrators but had no effect on dutch perpetrators. our findings show the effects of cultural background on communication alignment and demonstrate the benefits of using more formal language and messages that emphasize law and regulations when interacting with perpetrators high on uncertainty avoidance.",0
"this study examined juvenile justice-involved youths' understanding and appreciation of the miranda warnings' rights to silence and legal counsel using the miranda rights comprehension instruments (goldstein, zelle, & grisso, 2012). it also examined the relationships between totality of circumstances factors and understanding and appreciation of rights. data were collected from 183 youths (140 boys) in pre-and postadjudication facilities in 2 states. overall, youths demonstrated greater difficulty on measures of appreciation than understanding, with particular deficits in their abilities to comprehend the abstract concept of the right to silence. results varied slightly by instrument, highlighting the importance of a multimodal assessment of these complex abilities. examination of totality of circumstances factors identified relationships between some factors (e.g., age, verbal iq, academic achievement) and miranda comprehension, but revealed that other factors (e.g., gender, number of previous arrests) were not significantly related to miranda understanding or appreciation. the findings support a nuanced conceptualization of miranda rights comprehension that acknowledges the complexity of understanding and appreciating the warnings. empirical analyses also support the continued use of some totality of circumstances factors and abandonment of others. findings underscore the necessity of multimodal assessment and interpretation when conducting capacity to waive miranda rights evaluations.",1
"this 2-part study explored how exposure to negative pretrial publicity (neg-ptp) influences the jury process, as well as possible mechanisms responsible for its biasing effects on decisions. study part a explored how ptp and jury deliberations affect juror/jury verdicts, memory, and impressions of the defendant and attorneys. one week before viewing a criminal trial mock-jurors (n = 320 university students) were exposed to neg-ptp or unrelated crime stories (no-ptp). two days later deliberating jurors came to a group decision, whereas nondeliberating jurors completed an unrelated task before making an individual decision. neg-ptp jurors were more likely to vote guilty, make memory errors, and rate the defendant lower in credibility. deliberation reduced neg-ptp jurors' memory accuracy and no-ptp jurors' guilty verdicts (leniency bias). jurors' memory and ratings of the defendant and prosecuting attorney significantly mediated the effect of ptp on guilt ratings. study part b content analyzed 30 mock-jury deliberations and explored how ptp influenced deliberations and ultimately jury decisions. neg-ptp juries were more likely than no-ptp juries to discuss ambiguous trial evidence in a proprosecution manner and less likely to discuss judicial instructions and lack of evidence. all neg-ptp juries mentioned ptp, after instructed otherwise, and rarely corrected jury members who mentioned ptp. discussion of ambiguous trial evidence in a proprosecution manner and lack of evidence significantly mediated the effect of ptp on jury-level guilt ratings. together the findings suggest that judicial admonishments and deliberations may not be sufficient to reduce ptp bias, because of memory errors, biased impressions, and predecisional distortion.",0
"the aim of this study was to examine whether street gang membership, psychological factors, and social factors such as preprison experiences could predict young offenders' involvement in prison gang activity. data were collected via individual interviews with 188 young offenders held in a young offenders institution in the united kingdom. results showed that psychological factors such as the value individuals attached to social status, a social dominance orientation, and antiauthority attitudes were important in predicting young offenders' involvement in prison gang activity. further important predictors included preimprisonment events such as levels of threat, levels of individual delinquency, and levels of involvement in group crime. longer current sentences also predicted involvement in prison gang activity. however, street gang membership was not an important predictor of involvement in prison gang activity. these findings have implications for identifying prisoners involved in prison gang activity and for considering the role of psychological factors and group processes in gang research.",1
"this research examined whether confirming postidentification feedback following a mistaken identification impairs eyewitness memory for the original culprit. we also examined whether the degree of similarity between a mistakenly identified individual and the actual culprit plays a role in memory impairment. participant-witnesses (n = 145) made mistaken identifications from a ""similar"" or a ""dissimilar"" culprit-absent photo lineup. the similar lineup contained individuals who were similar in appearance to the actual culprit and the dissimilar lineup contained individuals who were dissimilar in appearance to the actual culprit. after their identifications, witnesses were given confirming feedback (""good job! you identified the suspect."") or no feedback. the experimenter then feigned having accidentally given the witnesses the wrong photo lineup. after telling witnesses to disregard whatever they saw in the first lineup, the experimenter gave witnesses the ""correct"" (culprit-present) lineup and told the witnesses to do their best to identify the culprit. identifying a dissimilar individual and receiving confirming feedback after a misidentification had independent impairing effects on memory for the original culprit. results extend the traditional conceptualization of the postidentification feedback effect by showing that confirming feedback not only distorts witnesses' retrospective self-reports, but it also impairs recognition memory for the culprit.",1
"persons with mental disorder are overrepresented in the criminal justice system. once involved in the criminal justice system, offenders with mental disorder are more likely to return to custody while on probation than their nondisordered counterparts, often for breaking the rules of community supervision. risk assessments and risk management strategies employed by probation officers can lead to higher rates of returns to custody for probationers with mental disorder, and the current study is the first to examine these experimentally. here, 234 probation officers provided risk assessments and risk management decisions based on a vignette portraying a probationer with mental disorder, substance abuse disorder, both, or neither. although substance abuse is a relatively stronger risk factor than mental disorder, mental disorder had a stronger effect on officers' risk assessments. in terms of risk management, mental disorder had the strongest effect on officers' desire to manage risk with forced mental health treatment. these findings suggest that training for probation officers in the relative utility of mental disorder in predicting risk, in addition to evidence-based risk management strategies that take the focus off mental disorder, may improve outcomes for probationers with mental disorder.",1
"the main purpose of the current research is to examine the applicability of the youth level of service/case management inventory (yls/cmi) in a japanese juvenile offender population. three hundred eighty-nine youths who were released from the five juvenile classification homes were followed for approximately one and half years. results show that the yls/cmi total score significantly predict recidivism. survival time analysis demonstrates that the yls/cmi total score also significantly predicted faster time to recidivism. the overall findings support adequate predictive validity of the yls/cmi total score, but subscales lacked content representativeness and predictive validity in this sample. canadian and japanese cultural differences in criminal history and substance abuse are contributors to the lack of content representativeness.",1
"in arizona v. fulminante (1991), the u.s. supreme court opened the door for appellate judges to conduct a harmless error analysis of erroneously admitted, coerced confessions. in this study, 132 judges from three states read a murder case summary, evaluated the defendant's guilt, assessed the voluntariness of his confession, and responded to implicit and explicit measures of harmless error. results indicated that judges found a high-pressure confession to be coerced and hence improperly admitted into evidence. as in studies with mock jurors, however, the improper confession significantly increased their conviction rate in the absence of other evidence. on the harmless error measures, judges successfully overruled the confession when required to do so, indicating that they are capable of this analysis.",0
"this research was a cross-validation study of the domestic violence screening instrument-revised (dvsi-r), using a diverse, statewide sample of 3,569 family violence perpetrators in connecticut, assessed in february and march of 2007. it analyzed re-arrest data collected during an 18-month period post assessment. three issues were central, which have been ignored in previous research on family violence risk assessment: (1) analyzing five refined measures of behavioral recidivism, (2) determining whether perpetrator characteristics and types of family and household relationships (beyond just heterosexual intimate partners) moderate the empirical relations between the dvsi-r and the behavioral recidivism measures, and (3) determining whether structured clinical judgment about the imminent risk of future violence to the victim or to others corresponds with recidivism predicted by the dvsi-r total numeric risk scores. the empirical findings showed that the dvsi-r had significant predictive accuracy across all five measures of recidivism. with one exception, these relations did not vary by gender, age, or ethnicity; and again with one exception, no significant evidence was found that types of family or household relationships moderated those empirical relations. in short, the evidence suggested that the dvsi-r was a robust risk assessment instrument, having applicability across different types of perpetrators and different types of family and household relationships. finally, the empirical findings showed that structured clinical judgment about imminent risk-to-victim and risk-to-others corresponded with the prediction of recidivism by the dvsi-r total numeric risk scores, but the effects of those scores were significantly stronger than the perceived risk-to-victim or the perceived risk-to-others.",0
"what explains controversy over outpatient commitment laws (ocls), which authorize courts to order persons with mental illness to accept outpatient treatment? we hypothesized that attitudes toward ocls reflect ""cultural cognition"" (dimaggio, p. annl rev sociol 23:263-287, 1997), which motivates individuals to conform their beliefs about policy-relevant facts to their cultural values. in a study involving a diverse sample of americans (n = 1,496), we found that individuals who are hierarchical and communitarian tend to support ocls, while those who are egalitarian and individualistic tend to oppose them. these relationships, moreover, fit the cultural cognition hypothesis: that is, rather than directly influencing ocl support, cultural values, mediated by affect, shaped individuals' perceptions of how effectively ocls promote public health and safety. we discuss the implications for informed public deliberation over ocls.",0
"research shows that power can lead to prosocial behavior by facilitating the behavioral expression of dispositional prosocial motivation. however, it is not clear how power may facilitate responses to contextual factors that promote prosocial motivation. integrating fairness heuristic theory and the situated focus theory of power, we argue that in particular, organization members in lower (vs. higher) hierarchical positions who simultaneously experience a high (vs. low) sense of power respond with prosocial behavior to 1 important antecedent of prosocial motivation, that is, the enactment of procedural justice. the results from a multisource survey among employees and their leaders from various organizations (study 1) and an experiment using a public goods dilemma (study 2) support this prediction. three subsequent experiments (studies 3-5) show that this effect is mediated by perceptions of authority trustworthiness. taken together, this research (a) helps resolve the debate regarding whether power promotes or undermines prosocial behavior, (b) demonstrates that hierarchical position and the sense of power can have very different effects on processes that are vital to the functioning of an organization, and (c) helps solve ambiguity regarding the roles of hierarchical position and power in fairness heuristic theory.",0
"on-demand firms provide services for clients through a network of on-demand workers ready to complete specific tasks for a set contractual price. given such on-demand work is defined by payment on short-term contracts with no obligation for continued employment, there is little reason to believe on-demand workers experience more than extrinsic motivation and a transactional relationship with the on-demand firm. however, using self-determination theory, we argue that to the degree that on-demand work fulfills innate psychological needs individual on-demand workers will develop intrinsic motivation, which further leads to organizational identification with the on-demand firm. across 2 survey-based studies we find support for this path to organizational identification. this adds to the literature on motivation and identification by strengthening the link between individual needs and the individual-organizational relationship. implications for theory and for the management of on-demand workers are discussed.",0
"this study addresses how job seekers' experiences of rude and discourteous treatment-incivility-can adversely affect self-regulatory processes underlying job searching. using the social-cognitive model (zimmerman, 2000), we integrate social-cognitive theory with the goal orientation literature to examine how job search self-efficacy mediates the relationship between incivility and job search behaviors and how individual differences in learning goal orientation and avoid-performance goal orientation moderate that process. we conducted 3 studies with diverse methods and samples. study 1 employed a mixed-method design to understand the nature of incivility within the job search context and highlight the role of attributions in linking incivility to subsequent job search motivation and behavior. we tested our hypotheses in study 2 and 3 employing time-lagged research designs with unemployed job seekers and new labor market entrants. across both study 2 and 3 we found evidence that the negative effect of incivility on job search self-efficacy and subsequent job search behaviors are stronger for individuals low, rather than high, in avoid-performance goal orientation. theoretical implications of our findings and practical recommendations for how to address the influence of incivility on job seeking are discussed.",0
"job satisfaction research has unfolded as an exemplary manifestation of the ""person versus environment"" debate in applied psychology. with the increasing recognition of the importance of time, it is informative to examine a question critical to the dispositional view of job satisfaction: are genetic influences on job satisfaction stable across different time points? drawing upon dispositional and situational perspectives on job satisfaction and recent research in developmental behavioral genetics, we examined whether the relative potency of genetic (i.e., the person) and environmental influences on job satisfaction changed over time in a 3-wave longitudinal twin study. biometric behavioral genetics analyses showed that genetic influences accounted for 31.2% of the variance in job satisfaction measured at approximately age 21, which was markedly greater than the 18.7% and 19.8% of variance explained by genetic factors at age 25 and age 30. such genetic influences were mediated via positive affectivity and negative affectivity, but not via general mental ability. after partialing out genetic influences, environmental influences on job satisfaction were related to interpersonal conflict at work and occupational status, and these influences were relatively stable across the 3 time points. these results offer important implications for organizations and employees to better understand and implement practices to enhance job satisfaction.",0
"although the term situational judgment test (sjt) implies judging situations, existing sjts focus more on judging the effectiveness of different response options (i.e., response judgment) and less on how people perceive and interpret situations (i.e., situational judgment). we expand the traditional sjt paradigm and propose that adding explicit assessments of situational judgment to sjts will provide incremental information beyond that provided by response judgment. we test this hypothesis across 4 studies using intercultural multimedia sjts. study 1 uses verbal protocol analysis to discover the situational judgments people make when responding to sjt items. study 2 shows situational judgment predicts time-lagged, peer-rated task performance and interpersonal citizenship among undergraduate seniors over and above response judgment and other established predictors. study 3 shows providing situational judgment did not affect the predictive validity of response judgment. study 4 replicates study 2 in a working adult sample. we discuss implications for sjt theory as well as the practical implications of putting judging situations back into sjts.",0
"many scholars assert that work and family demands are negatively related to individuals' long-term physical health, but few studies have explicitly examined this relationship. among these exceptions, most have employed a cross-sectional design that is limited in its ability to establish causality. we use body mass index (bmi) that generally increases during one's lifetime as an indicator of physical health, and seek to explore the amount of control individuals may have on this seemingly inevitable progression. drawing on conservation of resources theory, we propose that an increase in demands-both in the work realm (e. g., the number of work hours) and in the family realm (e. g., the number of spouse work hours)-is likely to speed up the increase of bmi. using a nationally representative sample of 4,264 individuals who were part of a dual-earner family between 1994 and 2010, we find that a within-person increase in weekly work hours, an increase in spouse weekly work hours, and an increase in the number of children are all related to a small within-person increase of the bmi growth trajectory. within-person increase in work responsibility demands is related to a small within-person decrease in the bmi growth trajectory. we discuss implications of the relationships between work and family demands and long-term physical health.",0
"this study uses meta-analysis and a qualitative review of exercise descriptions to evaluate the content, criterion-related, construct, and incremental validity of 5 commonly used types of assessment center (ac) exercises. first, we present a meta-analysis of the relationship between 5 types of ac exercises with (a) the other exercise types, (b) the 5-factor model of personality, (c) general mental ability (gma), and (d) relevant criterion variables. all 5 types of exercises were significantly related to criterion variables (rho = .16-.19). the nomological network analyses suggested that the exercises tend to be modestly associated with gma, extraversion and, to a lesser extent, openness to experience but largely unrelated to agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability. finally, despite sparse reporting in primary studies, a content analysis of exercise descriptions yielded some evidence of complexity, ambiguity, interpersonal interaction, and fidelity but not necessarily interdependence.",0
"the current study draws on the transactional theory of stress to propose that employees cope with hostile work environments by engaging in emotion-based coping in the forms of organization-directed deviance and psychological withdrawal. specifically, we propose that supervisors' hostile organizational climate perceptions act as distal environmental stressors that are partially transmitted through supervisors' abusive actions and that conscientiousness moderates the proposed effects. first, we hypothesize that supervisor conscientiousness has a buffering effect by decreasing the likelihood of abusive supervision. second, we hypothesize that highly conscientious employees cope differently from less conscientious employees. among a sample of employees and their immediate supervisors, results indicated that while hostile climate perceptions provide a breeding ground for destructive behaviors, conscientious individuals are less likely to respond to perceived hostility with hostile acts. as supervisor conscientious levels increased, supervisors were less likely to engage in abusive supervision, which buffered employees from the negative effects of hostile climate perceptions. however, when working for less conscientious supervisors, employees experienced the effects of perceived hostile climates indirectly through abusive supervision. in turn, less conscientious employees tended to cope with the stress of hostile environments transmitted through abusive supervision by engaging in acts of organization-directed deviance. at the same time, all employees, regardless of their levels of conscientiousness, tended to cope with their hostile environments by psychologically withdrawing. theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",0
"integrating research on polychronicity, team diversity, and team cognition, we hypothesized that shared temporal cognition (overlapping knowledge) and temporal transactive memory systems (differentiated knowledge) would moderate the effects of polychronicity diversity on team performance. results from 71 teams in an indian organization revealed opposing moderating effects in that shared temporal cognition attenuated, but temporal transactive memory systems amplified, the negative effects of polychronicity diversity on team performance. shared temporal cognition also exerted a strong, positive effect on team performance. study results provide support for the continued examination of polychronicity diversity and temporal team cognition.",0
"we proposed and tested a multilevel model, underpinned by empowerment theory, that examines the processes linking high-performance work systems (hpws) and performance outcomes at the individual and organizational levels of analyses. data were obtained from 37 branches of 2 banking institutions in ghana. results of hierarchical regression analysis revealed that branch-level hpws relates to empowerment climate. additionally, results of hierarchical linear modeling that examined the hypothesized cross-level relationships revealed 3 salient findings. first, experienced hpws and empowerment climate partially mediate the influence of branch-level hpws on psychological empowerment. second, psychological empowerment partially mediates the influence of empowerment climate and experienced hpws on service performance. third, service orientation moderates the psychological empowerment service performance relationship such that the relationship is stronger for those high rather than low in service orientation. last, ordinary least squares regression results revealed that branch-level hpws influences branch-level market performance through cross-level and individual-level influences on service performance that emerges at the branch level as aggregated service performance.",0
"focusing on a sample of nurses, this investigation examined the relationships of daily task accomplishment satisfaction (for direct and indirect care tasks) with changes in positive and negative affect from preshift to postshift. not accomplishing tasks to one's satisfaction was conceptualized as a daily workplace stressor that should increase daily negative affect and decrease daily positive affect from preshift to postshift. further, because of the greater centrality of direct care nursing tasks to nursing work role identities (relative to indirect care tasks), we expected that task accomplishment satisfaction (or lack thereof) for these tasks would have stronger effects on changes in affect than would task accomplishment satisfaction for indirect care tasks. we also examined 2 person-level resources, collegial nurse-physician relations and psychological resilience, as moderators of the relationships among these daily variables, with the expectation that these resources would buffer the harmful effects of low task accomplishment satisfaction on nurse affect. results supported almost all of the proposed effects, though the cross-level interactions were observed only for the effects of indirect care task accomplishment satisfaction on affect and not for direct care task accomplishment satisfaction on affect.",0
"research has not explored the extent to which seeking help from teammates positively relates to a person's own creativity. this question is important to explore as help seeking is commonly enacted in organizations and may come with reciprocation costs that may also diminish creativity. results based on 291 employees in a single division of a large multinational organization revealed that seeking help predicted creativity and mediated the relationship between intrinsic motivation and creativity. however, help seekers also incurred reciprocation costs in that they tended to give more help to teammates, and giving help to teammates was negatively related to creativity. in general, giving higher levels of help attenuated the positive relationship between help seeking and creativity. we also tested an integrated model to show that help giving moderated the mediated relationship between intrinsic motivation and creativity via help seeking, such that higher levels of help giving attenuated this mediated effect. we discuss theoretical and practical implications recommending additional research regarding the interpersonal creative process in team contexts.",0
"integrating theories of self-regulation with team and leadership literatures, this study investigated goal and process clarity and servant leadership as 3 antecedents of team potency and subsequent team effectiveness, operationalized as team performance and organizational citizenship behavior. our sample of 304 employees represented 71 teams in 5 banks. results showed that team-level goal and process clarity as well as team servant leadership served as 3 antecedents of team potency and subsequent team performance and team organizational citizenship behavior. furthermore, we found that servant leadership moderated the relationships between both goal and process clarity and team potency, such that the positive relationships between both goal and process clarity and team potency were stronger in the presence of servant leadership.",0
"we developed a dual-level transformational leadership scale to measure individual-focused behavior at the individual level and group-focused behavior at the group level, and we validated the scale using a sample of 203 members from 60 work groups in a canadian company. results show that individual-focused leadership behavior, at the individual level, was positively related to task performance and personal initiative; group-focused leadership behavior, at the group level, was positively associated with team performance and helping behavior. implications for leadership theory and practice are offered.",0
"this study examined the relationships among psychological contract breaches, organizational commitment, and innovation-related behaviors (generating, spreading, implementing innovative ideas at work) over a 6-month period. results indicate that the effects of psychological contract breaches on employees are not static. specifically, perceptions of psychological contract breaches strengthened over time and were associated with decreased levels of affective commitment over time. further, increased perceptions of psychological contract breaches were associated with decreases in innovation-related behaviors. we also found evidence that organizational commitment mediates the relationship between psychological contract breaches and innovation-related behaviors. these results highlight the importance of examining the nomological network of psychological contract breaches from a change perspective.",0
"researchers have assumed that low self-esteem predicts deviance, but empirical results have been mixed. this article draws upon recent theoretical developments regarding contingencies of self-worth to clarify the self-esteem/deviance relation. it was predicted that self-esteem level would relate to deviance only when self-esteem was not contingent on workplace performance. in this manner, contingent self-esteem is a boundary condition for self-consistency/behavioral plasticity theory predictions. using multisource data collected from 123 employees over 6 months, the authors examined the interaction between level (high/low) and type (contingent/noncontingent) of self-esteem in predicting workplace deviance. results support the hypothesized moderating effects of contingent self-esteem; implications for self-esteem theories are discussed.",0
"although professional sports are a major interest for consumers and a soaring contributor to economic growth, very little is known about how sports brands are built over time and what makes some sports clubs' market performance so much stronger than others. based on a unique dataset of 40 german professional soccer brands tracked from 1963 through 2014, this research studies how the value drivers recruitment, winning, and publicity feed sales-based brand equity (sbbe) and attendance. one of the novel findings is that not only do strong brands benefit from higher levels of sbbe, but they are also able to leverage sbbe more effectively the longer they are on the market, which widens the gap between strong and weak brands across time. we also find that the effect of the value drivers on attendance evolves from direct to indirect via sbbe. overall, the increasing brand leverage effect yields important implications for marketing theory and for sports brand management.",0
"it is widely accepted, and demonstrated in the marketing literature, that negative online word of mouth (nowom) has a negative impact on brands. the present research, however, finds the opposite effect among individuals who feel a close personal connection to the brand-a group that often contains the brand's best customers. a series of three studies show that, when self-brand connection (sbc) is high, consumers process nowom defensively-a process that actually increases their behavioral intentions toward the brand. study 1 demonstrates this effect using an experimental manipulation of sbc related to clothing brands, and provides process evidence by analyzing coded thought listings. study 2 provides convergent evidence by measuring sbc associated with smartphones, and followup analyses show that as sbc increases, the otherwise negative effect of nowom steadily transforms to become significantly positive. study 3 replicates these results using a combination of a national survey conducted by j.d. power investigating hotel stays and data drawn from tripadvisor. results of all three studies, set in product categories with varying levels of identity relevance, support the positive effects of nowom for high-sbc customers and have implications for both managers and researchers.",0
"many businesses increasingly use strategic partnerships to manage corporate environmental agendas. however, how value is created in green partnerships remains largely unexplored. to address this gap, the authors examine the effects of announcements of green partnerships (marketing versus technology) on shareholder value. it is argued that in green partnerships firms leverage marketing and technology-related capabilities for value-enhancing purposes. the results show that announcements of green marketing partnerships have an immediate positive and significant effect on shareholder value, whereas announcements of green technology partnerships produce an immediate negative and significant effect. nevertheless, green technology partnerships can accrue positive returns, but over a longer-term (1 year) period. in ""dirtier"" industries, it is more difficult to generate positive returns to green partnerships. counterintuitively, though, in high-polluting industries, firms having a history of positive environmental performance experience lower financial gains from announcements of green partnerships than firms that were less environmentally responsible in the past.",0
"this article offers a new perspective on customer-company identification (cci) by focusing on cci's underlying self-motives: self-uncertainty and self-enhancement. more precisely, an operationalization is proposed in which cognitive (ccicog) and affective (cciaff) dimensions of cci are driven by different self-motives: ccicog by self-uncertainty and cciaff by self-enhancement. focusing on these self-motives reveals that ccicog and cciaff affect some customer attitudes and behaviors in opposite ways but affect other attitudes and behaviors similarly. a cross-sectional survey that examines outcomes of ccicog and cciaff supports the proposed conceptualization of cci and suggests the dimensions differ in how each impacts customer-company relationships. furthermore, the study suggests that combining the dimensions together in higher order constructs or examining only one dimension can lead to misleading conclusions.",0
"this paper focuses on managers' marketing decision making during performance decline. drawing on the reconciliation of theories of failure-induced change and threat-rigidity by ocasio (1995), we examine how performance decline may result in a rigid decision-making process and decision characteristics that reflect the narrowing of attention and increased risk seeking. furthermore, drawing on managerial compensation research, we consider how incentive pay may affect the marketing decision-making process and decision characteristics of managers during performance decline. using a simulation game with experienced chinese managers, our results indicate that performance decline decreases marketing strategy process comprehensiveness but increases reliance on short-term marketing decisions, strategic change, and strategic risk taking. moreover, incentive pay attenuates the rigid decision-making process of managers but accentuates their heightened risk seeking during performance decline. this paper offers unique behavioral insights into how managers make marketing decisions.",0
"achieving customer loyalty is a primary marketing goal, but building loyalty and reaping its rewards remain ongoing challenges. theory suggests that loyalty comprises attitudes and purchase behaviors that benefit one seller over competitors. yet researchers examining loyalty adopt widely varying conceptual and operational approaches. the present investigation examines the consequences of this heterogeneity by empirically mapping current conceptual approaches using an item-level coding of extant loyalty research, then testing how operational and study-specific characteristics moderate the strategy -> loyalty -> performance process through meta-analytic techniques. the results clarify dissimilarities in loyalty building strategies, how loyalty differentially affects performance and word of mouth, and the consequences of study-specific characteristics. prescriptive advice based on 163 studies of customer loyalty addresses three seemingly simple but very critical questions: what is customer loyalty? how is it measured? and what actually matters when it comes to customer loyalty?",0
"this article presents a meta-analysis of the antecedents of buyers' perceived switching costs and switching. the authors synthesize results from 170 independent samples in 152 manuscripts and test several moderator effects and a causal meta-analytic model. the major findings are as follows: (1) of all antecedents, market-related variables (i.e., alternatives and competition) have the strongest influence on switching costs; they reduce these costs via affecting buyers' quality perception of a relationship and offerings. firm-related variables (e.g., seller investments) play a minor role as a driver of switching costs and switching, indicating a limited influence of firms' activities on switching costs. (2) switching costs have only a weak negative influence on switching. (3) a moderator analysis reveals that most of the effects are context specific. for instance, services (versus goods) decrease and b2c (versus b2b) settings increase the relationship between antecedents and switching costs. further, the moderating influence of year and culture indicate fundamental market changes and variations across countries. the study provides several implications for relationship research and management.",1
"studies have shown that the fit between a sponsoring brand and the sport, art, or charity sponsored influences outcomes such as brand awareness and image. this research adds the role of sponsor-sponsee similarity to the discussion of fit. the authors argue that similarity interacts with fit when conditions evoke suspicion or disrupt typical inferences regarding sponsorship relationships. interaction is particularly important when the sponsor seeks to develop its image by association with a cause, and is also of consequence for the cause in terms of its branding. three studies test sponsorship effects with respect to blood donation and cancer prevention organizations. results support the predicted moderated mediation model, showing that similarity between a corporate sponsor and a sponsored cause can interact with fit, influencing sponsorship evaluations directly and shaping attitudes and behavioral intentions toward constituents indirectly. this work reveals a counterintuitive effect of similarity for some sponsorship relationships.",0
"corporate brands are strategic assets for organizations, but it is difficult to understand the value added by corporate brand name changes because they often occur simultaneously with business restructuring initiatives. the authors test a framework that delineates the informational relationship between corporate name changes and business restructuring initiatives. the hypothesis is tested on a sample of jointly announced corporate name changes and business restructuring initiatives. the results show that jointly announced corporate name changes and business restructuring are significantly more informative than the sum of their individual effects. the results further suggest that the information complementarity arises because corporate brand name changes resolve uncertainty and help in coordinating business restructuring initiatives. the results do not support the view that corporate brand name changes are cosmetic and/or primarily signals for business restructuring. the study offers a promising research foundation for understanding the value of marketing actions announced jointly with other corporate events.",1
"the objective of this study is to analyse investors' perceptions of sponsorship's ability to increase brand equity, through the impact of sponsorship announcement on stock market value. an event study method, based on a unique sample of 293 worldwide sponsorship announcements from 2010, shows substantial negative abnormal returns following announcement dates. in addition, a cross-sectional regression analysis reveals the influence of several featured factors. philanthropic sponsorships and sponsorships of events with distinctive values are less negatively perceived by investors, but us companies exhibit more negative returns in shareholder value than other firms. this study offers no support for varying impacts of event audience, renewal agreement, property sponsorship and title sponsorship on abnormal returns though.",1
"multi-unit franchisees (mufees; i.e., franchisees that operate more than one outlet within a franchise system) represent a pervasive and even dominant form of franchise ownership in many sectors. however, much of the franchising literature has been developed with a focus on single-unit franchisees (sufees). the goals of this article are to introspectively compare mufees and sufees in terms of (1) the factors franchisees consider important when initially buying a franchise, (2) how these considerations change when sufees become mufees, and (3) how sufees and mufees characterize their relationships with their franchisors in terms of relational constructs. our data reveal significant differences between these two groups in terms of purchase motivations as well as relational sentiments. importantly, franchisor preferences for multi-unit franchising notwithstanding, it is the sufees that characterize their dyadic relationships with their franchisors as more relational as compared to their mufees counterparts.",0
"managers increasingly seek to develop brand loyalty through sponsorship activities, though this relationship has not been solidly established. this article models and demonstrates the impact of sponsorship on brand loyalty. the studied concepts and relationships emerge from both the sponsorship and consumer-brand relationship literature. the experimental design relies on before and after measurements and multiple exposures to the sponsorship. thus this study demonstrates that sponsorship exposure has a positive impact on brand affect, brand trust, and brand loyalty. the change in brand loyalty from before to after sponsorship exposure reflects two persuasion processes. first, self-congruity with an event enhances brand loyalty through event and brand affect. second, perceived fit between the event and the brand has a positive effect on brand affect, through attitude toward the sponsorship, and on brand trust, such that it ultimately influences brand loyalty. brand affect is identified as an important mediator of sponsorship effects.",0
"marketers want to encourage constituents to strongly identify with their organizations, because organizational identification contributes to positive firm outcomes. however, the extant research on organizational identity largely has overlooked the fact that an individual's ""self"" actually is a collection of multiple social identities. this study is the first to propose and empirically demonstrate that marketers can leverage customers' multiple societal roles (e.g., parent, environmentalist, professor) to build and reinforce their relationships with the firm. specifically, the research introduces the concept of ""identity synergy."" identity synergy occurs when individuals' involvement with an organization facilitates their pursuit of other important social identities. our study shows that customer perception of identity synergy is positively related to identification with an organization. moreover, the study helps explain the process by which antecedents of organizational identity (identity affirmation, identity support, and value congruence) positively affect customer-firm relationships by proposing and testing identity synergy as a mediator between these antecedents and organizational identification. the study also contributes to our understanding of organizational identity theory by introducing the new concept of peer identification, or identification with other members of the organization, such as other customers or volunteers. the empirical evidence demonstrates identity synergy's role in building peer identification, as well as peer identification's role in building organizational identification.",0
"drawing upon the market orientation literature and institutional theory, this study examines the factors that affect the implementation of market orientation in the subsidiaries of global companies, using data gathered from multiple informants and multiple sources in 79 subsidiaries located in 45 countries. findings indicate that the market orientation of subsidiaries is positively related to the legal institutions, local competition in the host country market, and the market orientation of headquarters. the findings also indicate that the headquarters' market orientation has more pronounced effects on the implementation of market orientation for subsidiaries that strongly identify with headquarters. moreover, the study demonstrates that cultural distance between home and host countries of the subsidiary strengthens the positive effects of competitive intensity on market orientation implementation. as such, this research addresses an important concern among researchers and managers that is related to how to increase the market orientation and, thereby, the performance of their subsidiaries located in foreign countries.",0
"extant research has identified a broad set of antecedents of innovativeness, with the assumption that maximizing as many of them as possible leads to sustained innovativeness. however, companies usually face resource constraints and therefore must strive to identify and combine the most important drivers of superior innovativeness effectively. this research addresses this practical challenge by identifying typical patterns of innovation orientation and their associated performance outcomes. drawing on configuration and boundary theory, the authors develop a framework and hypotheses, then use data from marketing managers, r&d managers, and customers to identify four patterns: integrated innovators, internally driven preservers, proactive customer-oriented innovators, and top-down innovators. the empirical results reveal performance differences across these patterns. an integrated approach leads to the highest innovativeness scores, but proactive customer-oriented innovators and top-down innovators enjoy the greatest financial success.",0
"using representative samples of u.s. and japanese retail service firms, this study explores whether one particular type of organizational culture is the best with respect to business outcomes (performance and customer satisfaction) or whether the optimum culture depends on the national context in which the firm is embedded. the findings suggest that there is a significant interaction effect of organizational culture with national culture on outcomes. specifically, the relationships between the importance placed on the cultural values of stability, people orientation, and detail orientation and outcomes are significantly greater for japanese than for u.s. service retailers. on the other hand, the relationships between the values of aggressiveness, innovation, and outcome orientation and outcomes are greater for u.s. retailers. further, the findings show that firms whose cultures match those of their home countries exhibit lower levels of outcomes when they operate in other countries with different cultural values. implications are given for how service retailers might be designed and managed for purposes of improving business outcomes.",0
"this article addresses a growing dilemma surrounding the strategic value of perceived brand foreignness (pbf) among consumers in emerging economies. building on recent research evidence from the brand origin literature, we introduce the concept of confidence in brand origin identification (cbo) and theorize its moderating impact on the value of pbf in explaining and predicting brand evaluation. using a multi-level modeling technique, this study provides evidence showing that cbo moderates the effect of pbf on consumer evaluations of brand value. moreover, the moderating influence of cbo is found to be more profound for local than for foreign brands. managerial implications for building both global and local brands in emerging markets are discussed.",0
"this research examines how consumers update their brand personality impressions and brand attitudes after interacting with one of the brand's employees. drawing on stereotyping theory, the author develops a framework that proposes that the impact of an employee's behavior depends on how the employee is categorized. when the employee is considered primarily as an exemplar of the brand's workforce, his or her behavior is generalized more strongly to the brand. when, however, the employee is judged as a relatively unique individual (i.e., when the employee is subtyped), the behavior is not transferred to the brand to the full extent. the results of three studies provide converging evidence and show that the degree to which consumers subtype an employee is determined by the amount of information they possess about the employee, the extent to which they depend on the employee, and their motivation to form an accurate impression. the findings have direct implications for marketers interested in understanding how employees affect the brands they represent.",0
"prior research has demonstrated that consumers who take an opportunity and are satisfied (satisfied takers) are likely to avail of a future opportunity when it is presented again but those who forsake an opportunity and experience regret (regretful forsakers) are less likely to do so, exhibiting inaction inertia. in this research we demonstrate when and why regret for inaction may result in the intent to avail of a future opportunity and compare this intent with that of satisfied consumers. specifically, we demonstrate in two studies that (1) when consumers forgo an opportunity and experience regret, they are motivated to avail of a similar opportunity when it is presented in the future, and (2) this intent by regretful forsakers may be more intense than that experienced by satisfied customers due to the elicitation of mental imagery regarding the anticipated consumption episode.",0
"we experimentally subliminally prime subjects prior to charity donation decisions by showing words that have connotations of pro-social values for a very brief time (17 ms). our main finding is that, compared to a baseline condition, the pro-social prime increases donations by approximately 10-17 % among subjects with strong pro-social preferences (universalism values). we find a similar effect when interacting the prime with the big 5 personality characteristic of agreeableness. we furthermore introduce a novel method for testing for priming, ""subliminity"". this method reveals that some subjects are capable of recognizing prime words, and the overall results are weaker when we control for this capacity.",0
"individual willingness to enter competitive environments predicts career choices and labor market outcomes. meanwhile, many people experience competitive contexts as stressful. we use two laboratory experiments to investigate whether factors related to stress can help explain individual differences in tournament entry. experiment 1 studies whether stress responses (measured as salivary cortisol) to taking part in a mandatory tournament predict individual willingness to participate in a voluntary tournament. we find that competing increases stress levels. this cortisol response does not predict tournament entry for men but is positively and significantly correlated with choosing to enter the tournament for women. in experiment 2, we exogenously induce physiological stress using the cold-pressor task. we find a positive causal effect of stress on tournament entry for women but no effect for men. finally, we show that although the effect of stress on tournament entry differs between the genders, stress reactions cannot explain the well-documented gender difference in willingness to compete.",0
"we report an experiment in which subjects may learn from each other. specifically, a ""queue"" of players who are identically informed ex ante make decisions in sequence over two lotteries. every player except the first in the queue observes (only) his immediate predecessor's choice and payoff before making his own decision. in equilibrium decisions are identical from the first or second player onwards in all experimental conditions. however, complete adherence to equilibrium play is seldom observed in our experiment. we further analyze our data using a quantal response equilibrium approach and test for behavioral regularities related to base rate fallacy/conservatism bias, social conformity/rebelliousness, and preference for experimentation (preferring the lottery with potentially more information spillover value). our estimations reveal a consistent preference for experimentation across conditions, and further analysis offers some support to our surmise that this behavioral regularity is due, in part, to an attempt to influence others behind in the queue.",0
"we analyze the effect of investments in corporate social responsibility (csr) on workers' motivation. in our experiment, a gift exchange game variant, csr is captured by donating a certain share of a firm's profit to charity. we are testing for csr effects by varying the possible share of profits given to charity. additionally, we investigate the effect of matching mission preferences, i.e., a worker preferring the same charity the firm donates to. our results show that, on average, workers reciprocate investments in csr with increased effort. matching mission preferences also result in higher effort, independently of the extent of the csr investment.",1
"we introduce non-enforceable property rights over a bargaining surplus in a dictator game with production, where the agent's effort is differentially rewarded and subsequently determines the size of the surplus. using experimental data, we elicit individual preferences over the egalitarian, accountability and libertarian principles and provide evidence to support the inability of these justice principles to individually account for the observed behavior. we show that the justice principle that can be used to explain dictators' choices depends on whether dictators are paid more or less than recipients for their effort. our findings suggest that dictators do employ justice principles in self-serving ways and choose in each context the justice principle that maximizes their financial payoffs.",0
"we show how bounds around preferences parameters can be estimated under various levels of assumptions concerning the beliefs of senders in the investment game. we contrast these bounds with point estimates of the preference parameters obtained using non-incentivized subjective belief data. our point estimates suggest that expected responses and social preferences both play a significant role in determining investment in the game. moreover, these point estimates fall within our most reasonable bounds. this suggests that credible inferences can be obtained using non-incentivized beliefs.",0
"in scientific collaborations, technologies have broadened access to scarce scientific and engineering resources. while broader access is often applauded, little attention has been focused on the problem of efficient and equitable resource allocation. this paper presents laboratory experiments designed to compare different allocation mechanisms for access to joint research facilities. specifically, we study the vickrey-clarke-groves (vcg) auction, a simultaneous ascending auction (the resource allocation design, rad), and a mechanism based on submitted rankings (knapsack). experimental results show that rad and vcg are both more efficient than knapsack, while knapsack achieves a more equal distribution of resources than rad or vcg. the findings highlight the need for systematic exploration of allocation mechanisms within collaboratories.",0
"the economics-of-crime approach usually ignores the emotional cost and benefit of cheating. in this paper, we investigate the relationships between emotions, deception, and rational decision-making by means of an experiment on tax evasion. emotions are measured by skin conductance responses and self-reports. we show that the intensity of anticipated and anticipatory emotions before reporting income positively correlates with both the decision to cheat and the proportion of evaded income. the experienced emotional arousal after an audit increases with the monetary sanctions and the arousal is even stronger when the evader's picture is publicly displayed. we also find that the risk of a public exposure of deception deters evasion whereas the amount of fines encourages evasion. these results suggest that an audit policy that strengthens the emotional dimension of cheating favors compliance.",0
"procurement auctions carry substantial risk when the value of the project is highly uncertain and known only to insiders. this paper reports the results from a series of experiments comparing the performance of three auction formats in such complex and risky settings. in the experiment, every bidder knows the private value for the project but only a single insider bidder knows the common-value part. in addition to the standard second-price and english auctions we test the ""qualifying auction,"" a two-stage format commonly used in the sale of complex and risky assets. the qualifying auction has a fully ""revealing"" equilibrium that implements the revenue-maximizing outcome but it also has an uninformative ""babbling"" equilibrium in which bidders place arbitrarily high bids in the first stage. in the experiments, the latter equilibrium has more drawing power, which causes the qualifying auction to perform worse than the english auction and only slightly better than a sealed-bid second-price auction. compared to the two other formats, the english auction is roughly 40% more efficient, yields 50% more revenues, avoids windfall profits for the insider, while protecting uninformed bidders from losses.",0
"the workplace intergenerational climate scale (wics) is designed to measure employees' attitudes and perceptions about workers of different ages in the workplace. in study 1, an initial 18-item measure was developed, reflecting five subscales: intergenerational contact, workplace intergenerational retention, positive intergenerational affect, workplace generational inclusiveness, and lack of generational stereotypes. scores on the five wics subscales were linked to workplace mentoring, opinions about older workers, and job satisfaction. in study 2, the wics items and subscales were further refined, and subscale relationships with similar constructs were explored via structural equation modeling. in study 3, a more occupationally diverse sample was used to support criterion, incremental, discriminant, and external validity. evidence supports the use of the wics as a valid and reliable multidimensional measure of an organization's intergenerational climate. copyright (c) 2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.",0
"in this study, we explore the theoretical model and structural dimensions of employee well-being (ewb) in organizations. specifically, using both qualitative and quantitative methods, we find that ewb comprises three dimensions: life well-being, workplace well-being, and psychological well-being. we establish the reliability and validity of the newly developed ewb scale through a series of quantitative studies, which indicate that ewb is significantly correlated with affective organizational commitment and job performance based on the data collected from multiple sources at two points in time. we find that ewb has measurement invariance (configural invariance) across chinese and american contexts. we also discuss the theoretical contributions of these findings to cross-cultural organizational behavior studies, along with the practical implications of our results. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd.",0
"this study examined a contextual predictor of abusive supervision. specifically, we hypothesized that job goals that are judged by supervisors to be exceedingly difficult to attain is a predictor of subordinate-rated abusive supervisory behavior. drawing on the cognitive theory of stress, we hypothesized that exceedingly difficult job goals assigned to supervisors predict abusive behavior directed at their subordinates, as mediated by the supervisors' hindrance stress and emotions (e.g., anger and anxiety). we collected data from employees and their immediate supervisors to test this theoretical model (n = 215 matched pairs). the results of this multisource field study provided support for the hypothesized relationships. in particular, assigned job goals that were appraised by supervisors as exceedingly difficult to attain predicted their hindrance stress. also, hindrance stress was positively related to anger and anxiety, which in turn predicted abusive supervision. theoretically, these findings contribute to research on goal setting, stress, and abusive supervision. in addition, these findings are practically important in that they provide suggestions on how to minimize abusive supervision in organizations. copyright (c) 2013 john wiley & sons, ltd.",0
"although our understanding of workplace stressors has grown across the past 30years, this research has generally ignored traumatic workplace stressors. this is a serious omission, given that many occupations (e.g., firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and police) are frequently exposed to traumatic stressors. as such, the first purpose of the current study was to examine the impact of exposure to traumatic stressors in firefighters. post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd), burnout, and absenteeism were investigated as cognitive, affective, and behavioral outcomes. additionally, we sought to investigate coping humor as a mechanism for dealing with traumatic stressors. we frame these expectations by discussing humor from a transactional theory of emotion/coping perspective, as well as through humor's social bonding feature and its ability to combat the physiological impact of stressors. we surveyed 179 firefighters at two time points on relevant variables, with dependent variables collected at time 2. the results indicated that traumatic events significantly predicted burnout, ptsd, and absenteeism and that coping humor buffered this relationship for burnout and ptsd. we discuss the implications of these findings and call for more research investigating occupations in which traumatic stressors are a concern, as well as for more integration of humor into the workplace literature. copyright (c) 2013 john wiley & sons, ltd.",0
"we draw from social categorization theory and the actor-observer hypothesis to extend previous research regarding receiving high levels of help from team members. specifically, we explore how a team member's performance feedback on how they handled a disproportionately heavy share of the team's workload and how their racial distance from the rest of their teammates affect the amount of helping that person receives from their teammates. results from a laboratory study in which 79 teams worked on a computerized, decision-making task demonstrated a three-way interaction between workload, performance feedback, and the racial distance between the feedback recipient and the rest of their teammates. racially distant negative feedback recipients who had a disproportionately heavy share of their team's workload received less help from teammates than their racially similar counterparts. copyright (c) 2012 john wiley & sons, ltd.",0
"recognizing that organizations are inherently political arenas, investigating the relationship between political skill and various individual and organizational outcomes is increasing in the literature because employees need political skill in order to work effectively in such environments. previous research, however, has not examined whether political skill is an indicator of promotability among different rater sources (i.e., bosses, direct reports, and peers). this study attempted to fill such gaps in previous research by examining whether the magnitude of the relationship between political skill and promotability differed depending upon which rater source was evaluating promotability. using data from 262 practicing target-managers from around the world, the authors found that target-managers with more political skill had higher promotability ratings from three different coworker perspectives and the magnitude of the relationship was different for bosses and peers vis-a-vis direct reports. furthermore, peer ratings of task-related leader behavior mediated the relationship between political skill and boss ratings of promotability. contributions of this study are discussed, as are limitations, future research directions, and practical implications. copyright (c) 2011 john wiley & sons, ltd.",0
"prior research on retail shrinkage has taken a largely individual-level approach to theorizing about why it occurs, showing that older employees are less prone to theft and more vigilant in preventing customer shoplifting than younger personnel. however, given the influence of organizational contexts on organizational behavior, theorizing about shrinkage may be enhanced by the consideration of business-unit level contextual variables. the present study addressed this concern by examining the relationship between store-level age composition, whistle-blowing (wb) climate, and shrinkage in 726 retail stores. results indicated that the negative mean age-shrinkage relationship was stronger when there was less age diversity or a climate more supportive of wb. moreover, the negative wb climate-shrinkage linkage was stronger when the mean age was higher. copyright (c) 2011 john wiley & sons, ltd.",0
"the number of mature job seekers actively pursuing employment is increasing, and it is critical to recognize the variety of needs and desires they want from employment. we hypothesized that mature job seekers would be grouped into meaningful clusters based on their desires for work and that these groups would differ regarding the work features they were looking for in a new job. using survey data from a sample of 173 mature job seekers over age forty, we identified three clusters: those who work primarily for monetary and family reasons (which we labeled satisficers), those who seek personal satisfaction and learning opportunities from employment (free agents), and those who seek employment for a broad variety of reasons (maximizers). these three groups differed in their preferences for work schedule, availability of benefits, and developmental opportunities. we conclude by discussing potential individual-level interventions and organizational recruitment and staffing strategies for different groups of mature job seekers. copyright (c) 2010 john wiley & sons, ltd.",0
"this longitudinal, quasi-field experiment tested whether perceived stress and increase in perceived stress are related to the resources of the individual, namely, personality (core self evaluation scale (cses)), physical fitness, social support (acceptance and/or rejection by peers), and cognitive abilities. perceived stress scale (pss) was administered at two points in time to participants in a two-day selection process for a military unit, whose stressful environment formed the manipulation in this study. baseline pss was obtained from soldiers before the selection activity, when threatened with resource loss. pss was next administered during the selection activity, when individuals had to cope with actual loss of resources and difficulty in regaining them. as expected, participants perceived more stress during the selection activity. participants with higher cses, higher cognitive abilities and higher levels of social support perceived lower stress levels prior to the activity. the increase in stress level was lower for participants with better fitness levels, but greater for participants rejected by their peers. exploratory analysis of resource overlap was conducted and revealed a contribution of few key resources to coping, even in the presence of other resources. copyright (c) 2008 john wiley & sons, ltd.",0
"despite the ubiquity of waste disposal in urban environments, there is little standardization of receptacle or signage design within and across jurisdictions. in three experiments, we explored the impact of waste disposal signage design on disposal behavior. specifically, we were interested in two primary questions in signage design: 1) what type of waste disposal information should be presented; and 2) how the information should be presented. we found that signs containing either icons or pictures of permitted items improved sorting performance compared to signs containing only words of the items; consistent positioning of the signs improved sorting performance compared to random positions for both pictures and icons; and presenting both permitted and prohibited items can interfere with performance when the signs are icons. the current study provides experimental evidence to demonstrate that the design of waste disposal signage can impact waste sorting performance in meaningful ways and highlights the need for graphical signage and bin standardization.",0
"numerous studies have demonstrated that natural environments have a profound effect on a range of human behaviours and states, but most of those studies have examined how natural environments affect individuals rather than interactions. we examined whether natural environments affect communication between parents and their 3- to 4-year-old children. using a novel experimental design, we show that parent-child communication is more responsive and connected in a natural environment compared to an indoor environment. this study is the first to demonstrate that human communication is influenced by natural environments. natural settings may constitute optimal environments for communication.",0
"consumers' food choices strongly affect the environment, particularly as a result of the production and consumption of meat. from an environmental standpoint, it is important to gain a better understanding of how consumers can be motivated to eat less meat, particularly in non-western countries where few studies on this topic have been conducted. the current study was conducted in china, where the level of meat consumption has increased rapidly. the findings indicate that prospective ""warm-glow"" feelings are positively related with consumers' intention to reduce meat consumption; this relation is stronger than the respective relations of both perceived sustainability and perceived health benefits with the intention to reduce meat consumption. prospective ""warm-glow"" feelings are more strongly positively associated with the intention to reduce meat consumption via curtailment, than with the intention to consume (more) meat substitutes.",0
"despite concern about environmental issues, many people engage in environmentally-unfriendly behavior. the present research introduces a novel predictor of environmentally friendly behavior: attitudes toward the prototypical environmentalist, or the favorability of a mental image someone has of the typical, representative environmentalist. based on previous findings linking prototype attitudes to behavior, we expected positive attitudes toward environmentalist prototypes to predict greater environmentally friendly behavior. in addition, the current studies used not just explicit, direct self-reports of attitudes, but also indirect measures of implicit attitudes, which are less intentional, less controllable, and less deliberate. as expected, studies 1 and 2 showed that positive implicit and explicit attitudes toward the prototypical environmentalist predict self-reported engagement in environmentally friendly behaviors. in study 2, positive implicit and explicit prototype attitudes also predicted greater likelihood of donating to an environmental charity. these findings provide the first demonstration of the utility of prototype models in environmentalism.

"this study examines the links between organizational support, trust in manager, psychological contract breach, job satisfaction, and workplace pro-environmental behavior. we tested the conditional indirect effect of organizational support and pro-environmental behavior through job satisfaction at different levels of psychological contract breach and trust in the manager. using a convenience sample (n = 651), the findings show that job satisfaction only mediates the effect of organizational support on pro environmental behavior at a low level of psychological contract breach. the findings also indicate that (low) psychological contract breach only moderates the conditional indirect effect of organizational support and pro-environmental behavior through job satisfaction at a high level of trust in manager. practical implications are discussed, and suggestions for future research are proposed.

"adolescents are experiencing an increasing number of psychological difficulties due to mental fatigue and stress. natural environments have been found to be beneficial to psychological wellbeing by reducing stress and improving mood and concentration for most people. however, a number of studies have suggested that this may not be the case for adolescents perhaps because they have different social and emotional needs (to be with friends, not to be bored), although evidence is lacking. in a field experiment with 120 16-18 year olds in the uk we tested restoration of stress and mental fatigue in an outdoor or indoor environment, alone, with a friend or while playing a game on a mobile phone. the findings showed greater restoration amongst adolescents who had been in an outdoor setting containing natural elements, compared with those who had been in an indoor one. moreover, being with a friend considerably increased positive affect in nature for this age group. the findings indicated that spending short school breaks in a natural environment with a friend can have a significant positive impact on the psychological wellbeing of teenagers.

"this study explores the relationships between place of residence, living in a threatened place and the subsets of place attachment: place identity and place dependence. six hundred participants living in south-west western australia in rural and urban areas with varying degrees of bushfire risk responded to surveys asking about their reasons for living in their local area, their place attachment and their socio-demographic details. manovas revealed a significant effect of place of residence on place identity with rural residents reporting higher place identity than urban dwellers. urban dwellers reported lower place dependence than rural dwellers except when they lived in a fire prone area, in which case their place dependence was on par with that of rural residents. socio-demographic predictors of both place identity and place dependence to the home and local area were also explored, these included length of residence, education, and owning one's home.

"do self-reports match objective behavior? we performed a meta-analysis to quantify the association between self-reported and objective measures of proenvironmental behavior, and to evaluate the moderating influence of two socio-demographic and seven methodological moderators. data from 6260 individuals or households, involving 19 measures of association in 15 studies, revealed a positive and nominally large (cohen, 1988) effect size (r = .46). however, this means that 79% of the variance in the association between self-reported and objective behavior remains unexplained, which is especially troubling given the environmental context. we conclude that although this effect size is conventionally large, it is functionally small for testing theory and devising intervention campaigns, possibly leading researchers to draw misleading conclusions about the usefulness of theories that employ self-reports to predict objective behavior. these findings highlight a crucial need for research that strengthens the validity of self-reports for well-defined types of environmental behavior.

"although the public's perception that climate change is caused primarily by humans rather than nature is a key predictor of public engagement with the issue, little research has examined the way in which climate change communication can influence public perception. drawing on attribution theory, this study found that american participants who were exposed to information about their in-group's excessive energy use were more likely to attribute climate change to uncontrollable (natural) rather than controllable (human) causes than were those who were exposed to information about an out-group's (china) excessive energy use and those in the control group. in addition, this attribution of climate change to nature was negatively associated with climate change concern for climate change and policy support for climate change mitigation. these causal relationships were reflected in the mediation path model.

"a growing body of evidence suggests that materialistic values may be negatively associated with pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors. this research used meta-analytic techniques to assess: the mean effect size of the correlation between materialistic values and pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors; the 'true effect size' adjusting for the reliability of the measures; and the effects of gender, age, population type and publication year on the size of the correlation. a significant, medium-sized association was found between materialistic values and both environmental attitudes and behaviors; these relationships were moderated by population type and publication year, but not by gender or age. adjusted for reliability, the effects increased considerably, largely due to the low reliability of both types of environmental measures. the implications for future research are discussed, particularly with regard to the importance of using more reliable environmental measures and collecting data from more cultures. practical applications are also highlighted, particularly as they might apply to environmental campaigns.

"we assessed environmental and perceptual correlates of walking and walkability for fifth graders from three communities attending two schools: a new urban/leed-nd pilot community, mixed, and standard suburban community. irvine-minnesota inventory (imi) walkability audits showed that new urban blocks provided more traffic safety, pleasurability, crime safety, density, and diversity. new urban routes offered greater traffic safety, accessibility, pleasurability, crime safety, and diversity, but suburban routes had greater housing density, net of controls (parental education, rooms in the home, home ownership, parent preference for child to walk to school). parents and children perceived new urban routes to be more walkable and children walked more when they lived on more walkable routes. the suburban hierarchical street design exposed children to varied traffic safety conditions by funneling their walks from cul-de-sacs to arterials. the new urban routes to a centrally located school passed by pleasant open spaces, suggesting how community organization can create better walking conditions.

"evolutionary psychology has been proposed as an analytic framework for the behavioral effects of landscapes displayed in advertising. in this study, an evolutionary and environmental psychology approach is used to analyze affective reactions to advertising depicting specific natural environments or urban scenes, both prominent ingredients of contemporary advertising imagery. the experimental field study exposed 750 participants at random to one advert of a set of 13 experimental green energy advertisements, each displaying a different biome. six basic emotional responses (pleasure, arousal, happiness, freedom, safety, and interest) as well as attitude toward the ad and brand attitude were assessed subsequently. anova and structural equation analysis were used for data analysis. results of the study confirm the leading opinion on generalized more positive behavioral effects toward visual stimuli representing nature scenes with biospheric contents as opposed to pictures of urban environments or desert settings. in line with earlier empirical research, further findings do not support the hypothesis on an innate preference for savanna landscapes in adults but confirm preferences for images of lush green landscapes with water and familiar biomes. overall results give significant support to the application of environmental and evolutionary psychology to advertising.

"existing trust research has disproportionately focused on what makes people more or less trusting, and has largely ignored the question of what makes people more or less trustworthy. in this investigation, we deepen our understanding of trustworthiness. across six studies using economic games that measure trustworthy behavior and survey items that measure trustworthy intentions, we explore the personality traits that predict trustworthiness. we demonstrate that guilt-proneness predicts trustworthiness better than a variety of other personality measures, and we identify sense of interpersonal responsibility as the underlying mechanism by both measuring it and manipulating it directly. people who are high in guilt-proneness are more likely to be trustworthy than are individuals who are low in guilt-proneness, but they are not universally more generous. we demonstrate that people high in guilt-proneness are more likely to behave in interpersonally sensitive ways when they are more responsible for others' outcomes. we also explore potential interventions to increase trustworthiness. our findings fill a significant gap in the trust literature by building a foundation for investigating trustworthiness, by identifying a trait predictor of trustworthy intentions and behavior, and by providing practical advice for deciding in whom we should place our trust.",0
"we examined the link between political engagement and the tendency to justify the sociopolitical system. on one hand, confidence in the system should be negatively related to political engagement, insofar as it entails reduced desire for social change; on the other hand, system confidence should also be positively related to political engagement to the extent that it carries an assumption that the system is responsive to citizens' political efforts. because of the combination of these 2 opposing forces, the motivation for political engagement should be highest at intermediate levels of system confidence. five studies revealed a negative quadratic relationship between system confidence and normative political engagement. in 2 representative surveys, polish participants with moderate levels of system confidence were more likely to vote in political elections (study 1) and to participate in solidarity-based collective action (study 2). two field studies demonstrated a negative quadratic relationship between system confidence and actual participation in political demonstrations (gender equality and teachers' protests in poland; studies 3 and 4). this pattern of results was further corroborated by analyses of data from 50 countries drawn from the world value survey: we observed negative quadratic relationships between system confidence and collective action as well as voting. these relationships were stronger in democratic (vs. nondemocratic) regimes (study 5). our results suggest that some degree of system confidence might be useful to stimulate political engagement within the norms of the system.",0
"values reflect how people want to experience the world; emotions reflect how people actually experience the world. therefore, we propose that across cultures people desire emotions that are consistent with their values. whereas prior research focused on the desirability of specific affective states or 1 or 2 target emotions, we offer a broader account of desired emotions. after reporting initial evidence for the potential causal effects of values on desired emotions in a preliminary study (n = 200), we tested the predictions of our proposed model in 8 samples (n = 2,328) from distinct world cultural regions. across cultural samples, we found that people who endorsed values of self-transcendence (e.g., benevolence) wanted to feel more empathy and compassion, people who endorsed values of self-enhancement (e.g., power) wanted to feel more anger and pride, people who endorsed values of openness to change (e.g., self- direction) wanted to feel more interest and excitement, and people who endorsed values of conservation (e.g., tradition) wanted to feel more calmness and less fear. these patterns were independent of differences in emotional experience. we discuss the implications of our value-based account of desired emotions for understanding emotion regulation, culture, and other individual differences.",1
"this study extends previous work on emotion communication across cultures with a large-scale investigation of the physical expression cues in vocal tone. in doing so, it provides the first direct test of a key proposition of dialect theory, namely that greater accuracy of detecting emotions from one's own cultural group-known as in-group advantage-results from a match between culturally specific schemas in emotional expression style and culturally specific schemas in emotion recognition. study 1 used stimuli from 100 professional actors from five english-speaking nations vocally conveying 11 emotional states (anger, contempt, fear, happiness, interest, lust, neutral, pride, relief, sadness, and shame) using standard-content sentences. detailed acoustic analyses showed many similarities across groups, and yet also systematic group differences. this provides evidence for cultural accents in expressive style at the level of acoustic cues. in study 2, listeners evaluated these expressions in a 5 x 5 design balanced across groups. cross-cultural accuracy was greater than expected by chance. however, there was also in-group advantage, which varied across emotions. a lens model analysis of fundamental acoustic properties examined patterns in emotional expression and perception within and across groups. acoustic cues were used relatively similarly across groups both to produce and judge emotions, and yet there were also subtle cultural differences. speakers appear to have a culturally nuanced schema for enacting vocal tones via acoustic cues, and perceivers have a culturally nuanced schema in judging them. consistent with dialect theory's prediction, in-group judgments showed a greater match between these schemas used for emotional expression and perception.",0
"concerning the dispositional determinants of prosocial behavior and cooperation, work based on the classic 5 personality factors, and especially agreeableness, has turned out somewhat inconsistent. a clearer picture has emerged from consideration of the hexaco model of personality though supported entirely by hypothetical behavior as criterion, so far. thus, in 2 studies and a reanalysis, we investigated ""actual behavior"" in the form of individually and socially consequential distribution decisions. as expected, hexaco honesty-humility consistently predicted prosocial behavior, including a theory-consistent pattern on the facet level. importantly, this pattern might explain why five-factor agreeableness has only sometimes been found to account for prosocial behavior. indeed, further results indicate that five-factor agreeableness comprises some aspects that are predictive of prosocial behavior aspects well covered by bexaco honesty-humility but also others that play no role for this criterion. as such, the links between five-factor agreeableness and prosocial behavior are well-covered by hexaco honesty-humility, but not vice versa. taken together, these findings hint that especially hexaco honesty-humility (and certain aspects of five-factor agreeableness) account for prosocial behavior thus explaining previous inconsistencies and providing a more nuanced understanding of the links between basic personality and prosocial or cooperative behavior.",0
"although aging involves cognitive and physical declines, it is also associated with improved emotional well-being, particularly lower negative affect. however, the relationship between age and global negative affect, versus discrete negative emotions, and the pathways that link age to lower negative affect are not well understood. we hypothesize that 1 important link between age and lower negative affect may be acceptance of negative emotional experiences. the present study examined this hypothesis in a community sample of 21- to 73-year-olds (n = 340) by measuring acceptance and multiple indices of negative affect: trait negative affect, negative experiential and physiological reactivity to a laboratory stress induction, daily experience of negative affect, and trait negative affect 6 months after the initial assessment. negative affect was measured using a discrete emotions approach whereby anger, anxiety, and sadness were assessed at each time point. age was associated with increased acceptance as well as lower anger and anxiety (but not sadness) across measurement modalities and time points. further, acceptance statistically mediated the relationship between age on the one hand and anger and anxiety on the other hand. these results are consistent with the idea that acceptance may be an important pathway in the link between age and lower negative affect. implications of these results for understanding the nature of age-related decreases in discrete negative emotions are discussed.",0
"five studies indicate that conceptualizations of power are important elements of culture and serve culturally relevant goals. these studies provide converging evidence that cultures nurture different views of what is desirable and meaningful to do with power. vertical individualism is associated with a conceptualization of power in personalized terms (i.e., power is for advancing one's personal status and prestige), whereas horizontal collectivism is associated with a conceptualization of power in socialized terms (i.e., power is for benefiting and helping others). cultural variables are shown to predict beliefs about appropriate uses of power, episodic memories about power, attitudes in the service of power goals, and the contexts and ways in which power is used and defended. evidence for the cultural patterning of power concepts is observed at both the individual level and the cultural-group level of analysis.",0
"this research explores the consequences of two states of mind on judgment: a subjective state, looking at the world from one's own eyes, and an objective state, in which one thinks of oneself from the imagined perspective of an external observer. in six experiments, we show that judgments people make while they are in a subjective state of mind are more influenced by metacognitive experience compared with judgments people make when they are in an objective state of mind. this is demonstrated in experiments 1-3, using two different manipulations for the two states of mind and two different fluency tasks. experiment 4 explores the underlying mechanism and demonstrates that an objective state does not lessen the metacognitive experience itself; rather, it affects the reliance on this experience as a relevant source of information. finally, in experiments 5 and 6 we investigate implications of our hypothesis for doing experimental research in psychology. we find that taking part in a laboratory experiment resembles the experimental condition of an objective state of mind, as participants rely less on their metacognition compared with conditions aimed to restore the subjective state of mind within the lab setting. we discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings regarding social influences on judgments and decisions in psychology labs and in the real world.",0
"theists often receive the benefit of being stereotyped as trustworthy and moral, whereas atheists are viewed as untrustworthy and immoral. the extreme divergence between the stereotypes of theists and atheists suggests that mental images of the two groups may also diverge. we investigated whether people have biased mental images of theists and atheists. the results suggest that mental images of theists are associated with more positive attributes than images of atheists (study 1), and these mental images influence who is believed to behave morally and immorally (study 2). together the findings suggest that mental images may represent a subtle mechanism reinforcing group-based prejudices.",0
"learning usually improves the accuracy of beliefs through the accumulation of experience. but are there limits to learning that prevent us from accurately understanding our world? in this article we investigate the concept of a ""learning trap""-the formation of a stable false belief even with extensive experience. our review highlights how these traps develop through the interaction of learning and decision making in unknown environments. we further document a particularly pernicious learning trap driven by selective attention, a mechanism often assumed to facilitate learning in complex environments. using computer simulation, we demonstrate the key attributes of the agent and environment that lead to this new type of learning trap. then, in a series of experiments we present evidence that people robustly fall into this trap, even in the presence of various interventions predicted to meliorate it. these results highlight a fundamental limit to learning and adaptive behavior that impacts individuals, organizations, animals, and machines.",0
"procedure invariance is a basic assumption of rational theories of choice, however, it has been shown to be violated: different response modes, or task frames, sometimes reveal opposite preferences. the current study focused on selection and rejection task frames, involving a unique type of problem with enriched and impoverished options, which has previously led to conflicting findings and theoretical explanations: the compatibility hypothesis (shafir, 1993) and the accentuation hypothesis (wedell, 1997). we examined the role of task frame by distinguishing these 2 hypotheses and evaluating the information-processing basis of the choices. experiments conducted online (experiments 1 and 3) and in-lab (experiment 4 with eye-tracking technique) revealed a difference between the 2 task frames in the choice data (i.e., the task-framing effect) as a function of the relative attractiveness of the options. also, this task-framing effect was not influenced by imposed time constraints (experiments 5 and 6) and was similarly evident with a more direct measure for the option attractiveness (obtained in experiment 7). experiment 2, conducted in a lab setting with verbal-protocol requirements, yielded no task-framing effect, suggesting that a requirement to verbalize reasons for choice minimizes accentuation. with this exception, the choice data are in agreement with the accentuation hypothesis, and the combined findings in choice, decision time, task confusion, and eye-tracking data provide evidence of a basis in cognitive effort rather than motivation, as wedell proposed.",0
"a growing set of studies suggests that our ability to infer, and reason about, mental states is supported by the assumption that agents maximize utilities-the rewards they attain minus the costs they incur. this assumption enables observers to work backward from agents' observed behavior to their underlying beliefs, preferences, and competencies. intuitively, however, agents may have incomplete, uncertain, or wrong beliefs about what they want. more formally, agents try to maximize their expected utilities. this understanding is crucial when reasoning about others' behavior: it dictates when actions reveal preferences, and it makes predictions about the stability of behavior over time. in a set of 7 experiments we show that 4- and 5-year-olds understand that agents try to maximize expected utilities, and that these responses cannot be explained by simpler accounts. in particular, these results suggest a modification to the standard belief/desire model of intuitive psychology. children do not treat beliefs and desires as independent; rather, they recognize that agents have beliefs about their own desires and that this has consequences for the interpretation of agents' actions.",0
"when a series of studies fails to replicate a well-documented effect, researchers might be tempted to use a ""vote counting"" approach to decide whether the effect is reliable-that is, simply comparing the number of successful and unsuccessful replications. vohs's (2015) response to the absence of money priming effects reported by rohrer, pashler, and harris (2015) provides an example of this approach. unfortunately, vote counting is a poor strategy to assess the reliability of psychological findings because it neglects the impact of selection bias and questionable research practices. in the present comment, we show that a range of meta-analytic tools indicate irregularities in the money priming literature discussed by rohrer et al. and vohs, which all point to the conclusion that these effects are distorted by selection bias, reporting biases, or p-hacking. this could help to explain why money-priming effects have proven unreliable in a number of direct replication attempts in which biases have been minimized through preregistration or transparent reporting. our major conclusion is that the simple proportion of significant findings is a poor guide to the reliability of research and that preregistered replications are an essential means to assess the reliability of money-priming effects.",1
"to account for disparate findings in the literature on automatic evaluation, gawronski, rydell, vervliet, and de houwer (2010) proposed a representational theory that specifies the contextual conditions under which automatic evaluations reflect initially acquired attitudinal information or subsequently acquired counterattitudinal information. the theory predicts that automatic evaluations should reflect the valence of expectancy-violating counterattitudinal information only in the context in which this information had been learned. in contrast, automatic evaluations should reflect the valence of initial attitudinal information in any other context, be it the context in which the initial attitudinal information had been acquired (aba renewal) or a novel context in which the target object had not been encountered before (abc renewal). the current article presents a meta-analysis of all published and unpublished studies from the authors' research groups regardless of whether they produced the predicted pattern of results. results revealed average effect sizes of d = 0.249 for aba renewal (30 studies, n = 3,142) and d = 0.174 for abc renewal (27 studies, n = 2,930), both of which were significantly different from zero. effect sizes were moderated by attention to context during learning, order of positive and negative information, context-valence contingencies during learning, and sample country. although some of the obtained moderator effects are consistent with the representational theory, others require theoretical refinements and future research to gain deeper insights into the mechanisms underlying contextual renewal.",1
"countless decisions, from the trivial to the crucial, are made in complex social contexts while facing uncertain consequences. yet a large portion of decision making research focuses on either the effects of social interaction or the effects of environmental uncertainty by examining strategic games against others or individual games against nature. drawing a connection between these approaches, the authors extend a standard individual choice paradigm to include social interaction with 1 other person. in this paradigm, 2 competing decision makers repeatedly select among 2 options, each offering a particular probability of a fixed payoff. when both players choose the same, correct option, the payoff is evenly split; when they choose different options, the player choosing the correct option receives the full payoff. the addition of this social dimension gives players an opportunity to fully exploit an uncertain environment via cooperation: by consistently choosing opposite options, two players can exploit the uncertain environment more effectively than a single player could. we present 2 experiments that manipulate environmental (experiment 1) and social (experiment 2) aspects of the paradigm. in experiment 1, the outcome probabilities were either known or unknown to participants; in experiment 2, participants' attention was drawn to individual or group gains by introducing either within- or between-group competition. efficient cooperation did not emerge spontaneously in experiment 1. instead, most people probability maximized, mirroring the behavior observed in individual choice. by contrast, between-group competition in experiment 2 facilitated efficient-but not always equitable-exploitation of uncertain environments. this work links the concepts of individual risky choice and strategic decision making under both environmental and social uncertainty.",0
"employment has become increasingly precarious in developed countries, meaning that, for many young adults, jobs provide neither benefits nor security, more work is part time, and employers are increasingly hiring workers from temporary help agencies and contract companies rather than as employees of their own company. these changes in employment relations have profound effects on gender roles and on family transitions of young adults, especially young men and in particular in countries such as japan, where there are rigid family norms and the male-breadwinner tradition still prevails. the authors examined the effects of the experience of non-regular work on the timing of marriage and whether this differs by sex. using recent life history data from japan, they found that men working in non-regular jobs are especially likely to postpone marriage. the implications of the growth of precarious work for changes in work and family institutions in japan are discussed.",1
"the authors compared male and female same-sex and different-sex couples in the netherlands with respect to age and educational homogamy. because many same-sex couples in the netherlands are married, differences between married and cohabiting couples were analyzed for all 3 groups. analyses of data from the dutch labor force surveys 2001-2007 (n=184,999 couples) showed that male same-sex couples are less homogamous in terms of age and education than different-sex couples. female same-sex couples are less homogamous in terms of age, but not in terms of education. no meaningful differences were found between married couples and cohabiting couples. partnership status appeared less important than the sex composition of the couple. given the relatively tolerant climate toward homosexuals in the netherlands, the similarity of the results with those yielded by studies conducted in the united states may be considered striking.",1
"research examining parental reports of children's living arrangements has often relied on information about legally ordered custody agreements following divorce. this analysis used data from matched pairs of parents (n = 1,156) in the fragile families and child wellbeing study who live apart to compare mother and father reports of their child's residence 5years after a nonmarital birth. the authors found that over one third of unmarried parents disagreed about who their child lived with and that conflicting reports were much more likely when fathers spent nights with the mother (an indicator of part-time cohabitation) and had overnights with the child on their own. the results further suggest that discrepancies in unmarried parents' reports were more closely associated with the complexity and ambiguity of their living situations than with the quality of their relationships with each other. implications for measuring children's living arrangements in families formed outside of marriage are discussed.",1
"literature from multiple disciplines suggests that women who are obese during early adulthood may accumulate social and physiological impediments to childbearing across their reproductive lives. this led the authors to investigate whether obese young women have different lifetime childbearing experiences than leaner peers by analyzing data from 1,658 female participants in the 1979 national longitudinal survey of youth. study sample members were nulliparous women ages 20-25 in 1982. the authors examined their childbearing experiences between 1982 and 2006 and found that young women who were obese at baseline had higher odds of remaining childless and increased odds of underachieving fertility intentions than young women who were normal weight at baseline. these results suggest that obesity has long-term ramifications for women's childbearing experiences with respect to whether and how many children women have in general and relative to the number of children they want.",1
"using data from a sample of 281 couples (the flourishing families data set), the authors tested a systemic theoretical model that examined the relationship among observed marital interaction, physical and mental health, and work satisfaction. the results showed that negative marital interaction was associated with significantly lower work satisfaction and poorer health for men. higher negative marital interaction scores were significantly related to elevated depression scores for both women and men. for both men and women, negative couple interaction was associated with work satisfaction through depression and health. overall, 34% of the variance in work satisfaction for men and 24% for the women was explained by the model. the results suggest that marriage-to-work spillover can be costly for families, organizations, and governments.",1
"this study uses data from married women in 30 nations to examine justice processes involving perceptions of fairness of the division of household labor and satisfaction with family life. relative deprivation theory suggests that national context-operationalized here as nation-level gender equity-might serve as a comparative referent used by married women when making determinations of the fairness of the division of household labor. multilevel analyses confirm that the effect of inequalities in the division of household labor on perceptions of fairness is moderated by national context, as is the effect of perceptions of fairness on satisfaction with family life. the effects are strongest in nations with high levels of gender equity, confirming two hypotheses suggested by relative deprivation theory.",1
"using longitudinal data from the fragile families and child well-being study (n = 1,162) and the national evaluation of welfare-to-work strategies (n = 1,308), we estimate associations between material and instrumental support available to low-income mothers and young children's socioemotional well-being. in multivariate ols models, we find mothers' available support is negatively associated with children's behavior problems and positively associated with prosocial behavior in both data sets; associations between available support and children's internalizing and prosocial behaviors attenuate but remain robust in residualized change models. overall, results support the hypothesis that the availability of a private safety net is positively associated with children's socioemotional adjustment.",1
"scholars have expressed concern that marketing's influence at the strategic levels of the firm is waning. consistent with this view, only 2.6% of firms' board members have marketing experience. the authors suggest that this is short-sighted and that including more marketing-experienced board members (mebms) will increase firm growth by (1) helping firms prioritize growth as a strategic objective and (2) contributing their expertise to improve the effectiveness of revenue growth strategies. drawing on the behavioral model of corporate governance, the authors develop a theoretical framework explicating the situational, dispositional, and structural influence moderators that alter the impact ofmebms on firm growth. using 64,086 director biographies from s&p 1500 firms, the authors find that mebms positively affect firm-level revenue growth and that this relationship is strengthened or weakened by important contingencies that occur in the firm. the findings suggest that the common practice of not including experienced marketers on boards of directors puts firms at a competitive disadvantage.",0
"scholars identify several benefits of new product introductions (npi), yet prior literature largely overlooks how the process of npi generates marketplace insights and influences subsequent products. building on the concept of absorptive capacity, the authors argue that the influence of products on firm value depends on process characteristics, namely, the pace, irregularity, and scope of npi. using data collected from multiple sources for products introduced by pharmaceutical firms between 1991 and 2015 and robust econometric methods that account for endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity, this study reveals that pace and scope have an inverted u-shaped effect on firm value, whereas irregularity negatively influences firm value. moreover, strategic emphasis and product complexity negatively moderate the relationship of the irregularity and scope of npi with firm value. this research documents the importance of adopting a portfolio approach to the sequential introduction of new products and incorporating insights gained from previous product introductions; it cautions managers against evaluating products in isolation. the authors discuss the economic significance of these results and provide actionable guidance for managers.",0
"a product's physical appearance is difficult to quantify, and the impact of product appearance on demand has rarely been studied using market data. the authors adopt a recently developed morphing technique to measure a product's aesthetic design and investigate its effect on consumer preference. drawing upon categorization theory, the authors consider the effects of three dimensions of aesthetic design-segment prototypicality (sp), brand consistency (bc), and cross-segment mimicry (csm)-and their moderating effects on marketing mix effectiveness in a unified framework. the empirical analysis uses a unique, large data set consisting of 202 car models from 33 brands sold in the united states from 2003 to 2010. the authors find that consumer preference peaks at moderate levels of sp and bc and that economy-segment products benefit from csm of luxury products. moreover, sp intensifies price sensitivity, and bc muffles price sensitivity while increasing advertising effectiveness. two what-if studies illustrate how managers can use the empirical model to evaluate alternative aesthetic design choices.",0
"firms commonly add small financial benefits to communications designed to acknowledge consumers' loyalty or support. yet is it always better to provide some financial benefit as opposed to simply saying ""thank you""? although this question has important implications for customer relationship management, research has not yet provided an answer. this article demonstrates that, indeed, a financial acknowledgment (defined as an acknowledgment with a monetary benefit) can lead to less positive outcomes than offering a verbal acknowledgment (defined as an acknowledgment without a monetary benefit), a phenomenon termed the ""trivialization effect."" the results explain this effect in terms of shifting evaluation standards: whereas a verbal acknowledgement is evaluated relative to verbal gratitude expression norms, a financial acknowledgment is evaluated relative to both verbal norms and customers' monetary expectations. the authors also demonstrate two practical, theory-consistent ways firms can structure financial acknowledgments to eliminate the trivialization effect. thus, this research shows both the peril of small financial benefits as a means of expressing customer appreciation and practical, low-cost ways to salvage their potential.",0
"the recent surge in the importance of shopper marketing has led to an increased need to understand the drivers of unplanned purchases. the authors address this issue by examining how elements of the current shopping trip (e.g., lagged unplanned purchase, cumulative purchases) and previous shopping trips (e.g., average historical price paid by the shopper) determine unplanned versus planned purchases on the current trip. using a grocery field study and frequent-shopper-program data, the authors estimate competing models to test behavioral hypotheses using a hierarchical bayesian probit model with state dependence and serially correlated errors. the results indicate that shoppers with smaller trip budgets tend to exhibit behavior consistent with a self-regulation model (i.e., an unplanned purchase decreases the probability of a subsequent unplanned vs. planned purchase), but this effect reverses later in the trip. in contrast, shoppers with medium-sized trip budgets tend to exhibit behavior consistent with a cuing theory model (i.e., an unplanned purchase increases the probability of a subsequent unplanned vs. planned purchase), and this effect increases as the trip continues. the article concludes with a discussion of implications for research and practice.",0
"in business-to-business markets, suppliers often ask an existing customer to provide a referral for them (i.e., a supplier-selected referral), in which the supplier selects a referrer to influence a specific potential customer favorably. the selection of the referrer is important because the right referrer providing the right message can generate business for the supplier. to study supplier-selected referrals, the authors extend the dyadic source-message-recipient communication framework to propose a framework that incorporates the supplier and the supplier's management of the communication between the referrer and the potential customer. they label this framework the managed triadic communication (matric) framework. the authors conduct three experimental studies in which they apply the matric framework to the domain of supplier-selected referrals and focus on the contingent role of supplier uncertainty. the authors find that the benefits of a supplier-selected referral are contingent on supplier uncertainty. for example, their findings imply that an outsupplier should focus on selecting a referrer that would give an all-positive evaluation (vs. a balanced evaluation), whereas an insupplier should focus on selecting a highly credible referrer, even if that referral does not provide an all-positive evaluation of the supplier.",0
"although the goal of a product recall program is to enhance safety, little is known about whether firms learn from product recalls. this study tests the direct effect of product recalls on future accidents and future recall frequency and their indirect effect through future product reliability in the automobile industry. the authors test the hypotheses on 459 make/year observations involving 27 automobile makers between 1995 and 2011. the findings suggest that increases in recall magnitude lead to decreases in future number of injuries and recalls. this effect, in turn, is partially mediated by future changes in product reliability. the results also suggest that the positive relationship between recall magnitude and future product reliability is (1) stronger for firms with higher shared product assets and (2) weaker for brands of higher prior quality. the findings are robust across alternate measures and alternate model specifications and offer valuable insights for managerial practice and public policy.",1
"customer referral programs are an effective means of customer acquisition. by assessing a large-scale customer data set from a global cellular telecommunications provider, the authors show that participation in a referral program also increases existing customers' loyalty. in a field experiment, recommenders' defection rates fell from 19% to 7% within a year, and their average monthly revenue grew by 11.4% compared with a matched control group. a negative interaction between referral program participation and customer tenure reveals that the loyalty effect of voicing a recommendation is particularly pronounced for newer customer-firm relationships. a laboratory experiment further demonstrates that referral programs with larger rewards strengthen attitudinal and behavioral loyalty, whereas smaller rewards affect only the behavioral dimension. this article contributes to our theoretical understanding of the roles played by the commitment-consistency principle and positive reinforcement theory as mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of customer referral programs.",0
"firms raise a significant amount of funds and gain competitive advantage over their rivals through equity financing, namely through initial public offerings and seasoned equity offerings. the authors find that both initial public offering firms and seasoned equity offering firms adopt a more aggressive marketing strategy during the two years following their offering. however, not all equity issuers benefit equally from increased marketing spending, which can help signal companies' growth prospects to investors. a key moderator of the link between marketing investment and firm value is the strategic flexibility of rivals with respect to issuers. in particular, the stock market reacts favorably to an aggressive marketing strategy initiated by issuers competing against rivals with relatively less flexibility, whereas increased marketing expenditures do not translate into higher firm value when rivals have greater flexibility. furthermore, the authors show that marketing expenditures create value within context: the role of marketing in enhancing shareholder value and the moderating effect of rivals' strategic flexibility are more pronounced in the two-year window immediately following an equity offering than at any other time. the authors conclude with a discussion of implications for theory and practice.",1
"extant research confirms the importance of value cocreation through customer participation (cp), but relatively little is known about whether and how it creates an enjoyable experience for customers and service employees and the consequential outcomes of this positive affective experience. this study applies the concept of flow as an overarching framework and draws theoretical support from social cognitive theory, particularly its extension (i.e., the conceptual model of relational efficacy beliefs), to examine how customers and employees derive enjoyment from cp conditional on their perceived efficacy of themselves (self-efficacy [se]) and their partners (other-efficacy [oe]) in financial services. empirical results from 223 client financial adviser dyads confirm that participation enjoyment, in addition to economic and relational values, mediates the impact of cp on participants' satisfaction evaluations, with se positively moderating cp's impact on participation enjoyment. the synergistic effect of se and oe on participation enjoyment also differs for clients versus financial advisers: even incongruent levels of se and oe can enhance participation enjoyment as long as they help validate role expectations of the respective participants.",0
"as interfirm collaboration plays an increasingly important role in firm innovation, many firms are engaged in multiple partnerships, forming portfolios of alliances. research in marketing has predominantly focused on dyadic relationships without considering the important interdependencies among different alliances. this study takes a portfolio approach to examine the resource diversity of multiple alliance partners and its contribution to firm innovation. the authors argue that resource diversity in an alliance portfolio can only benefit innovation when resources and information are shared across alliances. they examine factors that may facilitate or inhibit information and resource sharing across alliances and thus influence the realization of any benefit of portfolio resource diversity. the model identifies various factors along three dimensions, including the composition of an alliance portfolio, alliance management, and the market environment, that moderate the relationship between alliance portfolio resource diversity and firm innovation. this study not only demonstrates the conditions for a firm to benefit from diverse partners but also highlights the importance of coordination among different alliances, suggesting a portfolio approach for alliance research.",0
"two-sided markets are composed of platform owners and two distinct user networks that either buy or sell applications for the platform. the authors focus on multihoming-the choice of an agent in a user network to use more than one platform. in the context of the video game console industry, they examine the conditions affecting seller-level multihoming decisions on a given platform. furthermore, they investigate how platform-level multihoming of applications affects the sales of the platform. the authors show that increased platform-level multihoming of applications hurts platform sales, a finding consistent with literature on brand differentiation, but they also show that this effect vanishes as platforms mature or gain market share. the authors find that platform-level multihoming of applications affects platform sales more strongly than the number of applications. furthermore, among mature platforms, an increasing market share leads to more seller-level multihoming, while among nascent platforms, seller-level multihoming decreases as platform market share increases. these findings prompt scholars to look beyond network size in analyzing two-sided markets and provide guidance to both (application) sellers and platform owners.",0
"this study explores the role of customers' social network in their defection from a service provider. the authors use data on communication among one million customers of a cellular company to create a large-scale social system composed of customers' individual social networks. the study's results indicate that exposure to a defecting neighbor is associated with an increase of 80% in the defection hazard, after controlling for a host of social, personal, and purchase-related variables. this effect is comparable in both magnitude and nature to social effects observed in the highly researched case of product adoption: the extent of social influence on retention decays exponentially over time, and the likelihood of defection is affected by tie strength and homophily with defecting neighbors and by these neighbors' average number of connections. highly connected customers are more affected, and loyal customers are less affected by defections that occur in their social networks. these results carry important implications for the theoretical understanding of the drivers of customer retention and should be considered by firms that aim to predict and affect customer retention.",0
"in this article, the authors find that consumers' preferences change as a function of their temporal distance from the receipt of their last salary. the authors propose and test that when consumers have just received their salary (""the near-salary condition""), they exhibit promotion motivations in their product preferences. however, they exhibit prevention motivations in their product preferences when significant time has elapsed since their last salary receipt (""the far-from-salary condition""). the authors collected data from two longitudinal studies to validate these findings and to test the underlying process. using actual purchase behavior and collecting product preference during a one-month period, the authors show that consumers' product preferences change in response to temporal distance from their last salary receipt. the findings suggest to managers that the best time to promote products or messages with a promotion appeal is near to consumers' last salary receipt and that the best time to promote products or messages with a prevention appeal is far from consumers' last salary receipt.",0
"advertising needs to capture consumers' attention in likable ways, and the visual complexity of advertising plays a central role in this regard. yet ideas about visual complexity effects conflict, and objective measures of complexity are rare. the authors distinguish two types of visual complexity, differentiate them from the difficulty of comprehending advertising, and propose objective measures for each. advertisements are visually complex when they contain dense perceptual features (""feature complexity"") and/or when they have an elaborate creative design (""design complexity""). an analysis of 249 advertisements that were tested with eye-tracking shows that, as the authors hypothesize, feature complexity hurts attention to the brand and attitude toward the ad, whereas design complexity helps attention to both the pictorial and the advertisement as a whole, its comprehensibility, and attitude toward the ad. this is important because design complexity is under direct control of the advertiser. the proposed measures can be readily adopted to assess the visual complexity of advertising, and the findings can be used to improve the stopping power of advertisements.",0
"prior research on relative thinking has suggested that the willingness to seek a bargain depends not only on the absolute value of the bargain but also on the price of the product. for example, a discount of $10 seems more appealing on a product whose regular price is $20 than a product whose regular price is $60. by invoking the interactive role of consumers' reference prices, the authors delineate the specific conditions under which the same $10 discount can seem less appealing when the price is $20 than when it is $60. they present a formal model that simultaneously incorporates the effects of relative and referent thinking and yields novel predictions, which are supported in four laboratory experiments. their results reveal that deviation from the reference price determines when relative thinking holds and when it gets reversed. specifically, the relative-thinking effect holds when the actual price is the same as expected, it reverses when the actual price deviates from the expected price, but it emerges again when deviation from the expected price becomes extreme. the authors conclude with the theoretical and managerial implications of their findings for marketing activities, such as the allocation of sales promotion budgets.",0
"this study examines the diffusion of market orientation (mo) as a social learning process to acquire and transfer individual-level mo. central to the diffusion are important work-group members, or envoys. through their market-oriented action, top managers serve as market-oriented role models to two important types of observers in work groups-formal middle managers and work-group expert peers. in turn, these observers become top managers' envoys and role models of market-oriented behavior to frontline employees. empirical results from a three-level data set from a fortune 500 company support this perspective. while envoys who are neither market oriented nor identified with the firm are the least effective, envoys who are not market oriented but are strongly identified with the firm are also detrimental. network size hinders the informal route of learning through expert peers but not the formal route through middle managers. by identifying who the important work-group envoys are and under what conditions certain envoys are likely to be most effective, this study helps managers select the best envoys to implement mo.",0
"pay what you want (pwyw) is a new participative pricing mechanism in which consumers have maximum control over the price they pay. previous research has suggested that participative pricing increases consumers' intent to purchase. however, sellers using pwyw face the risk that consumers will exploit their control and pay nothing at all or a price below the seller's costs. in three field studies, the authors find that prices paid are significantly greater than zero. they analyze factors that influence prices paid and show that pwyw can even lead to an increase in seller revenues.",1
"prior research has found inconsistent effects of diversity on group performance. the present research identifies hormonal factors as a critical moderator of the diversity-performance connection. integrating the diversity, status, and hormone literatures, we predicted that groups collectively low in testosterone, which orients individuals less toward status competitions and more toward cooperation, would excel with greater group diversity. in contrast, groups collectively high in testosterone, which is associated with a heightened status drive, would be derailed by diversity. analysis of 74 randomly assigned groups engaged in a group decision-making exercise provided support for these hypotheses. the findings suggest that diversity is beneficial for performance, but only if group-level testosterone is low; diversity has a negative effect on performance if group-level testosterone is high. too much collective testosterone maximizes the pains and minimizes the gains from diversity.",0
"using a lifting and balancing task, we contrasted two alternative views of planning joint actions: one postulating that joint action involves distinct predictions for self and other, the other postulating that joint action involves coordinated plans between the coactors and reuse of bimanual models. we compared compensatory movements required to keep a tray balanced when 2 participants lifted glasses from each other's trays at the same time (simultaneous joint action) and when they took turns lifting (sequential joint action). compared with sequential joint action, simultaneous joint action made it easier to keep the tray balanced. thus, in keeping with the view that bimanual models are reused for joint action, predicting the timing of their own lifting action helped participants compensate for another person's lifting action. these results raise the possibility that simultaneous joint actions do not necessarily require distinguishing between one's own and the coactor's contributions to the action plan and may afford an agent-neutral stance.",0
"in the studies reported here, we conducted longitudinal analyses of preelection polling data to test whether an ebola outbreak predicted voting intentions preceding the 2014 u.s. federal elections. analyses were conducted on nationwide polls pertaining to 435 house of representatives elections and on state-specific polls pertaining to 34 senate elections. analyses compared voting intentions before and after the initial ebola outbreak and assessed correlations between internet search activity for the term ""ebola"" and voting intentions. results revealed that (a) the psychological salience of ebola was associated with increased intention to vote for republican candidates and (b) this effect occurred primarily in states characterized by norms favoring republican party candidates (the effect did not occur in states with norms favoring democratic party candidates). ancillary analyses addressed several interpretational issues. overall, these results suggest that disease outbreaks may influence voter behavior in two psychologically distinct ways: increased inclination to vote for politically conservative candidates and increased inclination to conform to popular opinion.",0
"how efficiently do people integrate the disconnected image fragments that fall on their eyes when they view partly occluded objects? in the present study, i used a psychophysical summation-at-threshold technique to address this question by measuring discrimination performance with both isolated and combined features of physically fragmented but perceptually complete objects. if visual completion promotes superior integration efficiency, performance with a visually completed object should exceed what would be expected from performance with the individual object parts shown in isolation. contrary to this prediction, results showed that discrimination performance with both static and moving versions of physically fragmented but perceptually complete objects was significantly worse than would be expected from performance with their constituent parts. these results present a challenge for future theories of visual completion.",0
"obesity is a major public health problem, but despite much research into its causes, scientists have largely neglected to examine laypeople's personal beliefs about it. such naive beliefs are important because they guide actual goal-directed behaviors. in a series of studies across five countries on three continents, we found that people mainly believed either that obesity is caused by a lack of exercise or that it is caused by a poor diet. moreover, laypeople who indicted a lack of exercise were more likely to actually be overweight than were those who implicated a poor diet. this effect held even after controlling for several known correlates of body mass index (bmi), thereby explaining previously unexplained variance. we also experimentally demonstrated the mechanism underlying this effect: people who implicated insufficient exercise tended to consume more food than did those who indicted a poor diet. these results suggest that obesity has an important, pervasive, and hitherto overlooked psychological antecedent.",0
"tasks that tax working memory (wm) have consistently been found to decrease mind wandering. these findings may indicate that maintenance of mind wandering requires wm resources, such that mind wandering cannot persist when wm resources are being consumed by a task. an alternative explanation for these findings, however, is that mind wandering persists without the support of wm but is nonetheless decreased during any demanding task because good task performance requires that attention be restricted from task-unrelated thought (tut). the present study tested these two competing theories by investigating whether individuals with greater wm resources mind-wander more during an undemanding task, as would be predicted only by the theory that wm supports tut. we found that individuals with higher wm capacity reported more tut in undemanding tasks, which suggests that wm enables the maintenance of mind wandering.",0
"humans and other animals express power through open, expansive postures, and they express powerlessness through closed, contractive postures. but can these postures actually cause power? the results of this study confirmed our prediction that posing in high-power nonverbal displays (as opposed to low-power nonverbal displays) would cause neuroendocrine and behavioral changes for both male and female participants: high-power posers experienced elevations in testosterone, decreases in cortisol, and increased feelings of power and tolerance for risk; low-power posers exhibited the opposite pattern. in short, posing in displays of power caused advantaged and adaptive psychological, physiological, and behavioral changes, and these findings suggest that embodiment extends beyond mere thinking and feeling, to physiology and subsequent behavioral choices. that a person can, by assuming two simple 1-min poses, embody power and instantly become more powerful has real-world, actionable implications.",0
"the article studies interfirm governance in the context of supplier-reseller relationships. using a longitudinal study, the authors examine the roles of supplier selection efforts and mutual specific investments with respect to (1) motivating a supplier to make incremental investments and (2) safeguarding these investments from supplier ex post transaction costs. the authors also examine the joint effects of selection efforts and mutual investments on supplier ex post transaction costs. from a practical standpoint, the findings suggest guidelines for channel strategy. theoretically, they provide new insights into relationship dynamics, including evidence regarding the effects of a firm's governance choices over time.",0
"firms often vie for competitive advantage by providing additional services (amenities) to their customers. although extant research has focused on the effect of adding amenities on choice, return on service amenities may arise from two sources: increased initial choice and increased revenues from repurchase. the authors develop a return on investment (roi) model to capture how service amenities produce financial return from these two sources. they apply the model to hotel amenities, using a discrete choice experiment and a large-scale customer database developed in collaboration with a multibrand global hotel company. the authors employ a hierarchical bayesian formulation to estimate the parameters. they use the estimation results to compare roi for three amenities for six brands and find that returns vary across amenities, and returns on a single amenity can vary substantially across brands. the authors validate the results for one amenity against the roi from the actual historical implementation of that amenity using a natural experiment with a before/after design with controls. the present research demonstrates that the return on service amenities model provides a useful decision tool for managers deciding which amenities are most profitable.",1
"the authors investigate whether sellers treat consumers differently on the basis of how well informed consumers appear to be. they implement a large-scale field experiment in which callers request price quotes from automotive repair shops. the authors show that sellers alter their initial price quotes depending on whether consumers appear to be correctly informed, uninformed, or misinformed about market prices. the authors find that repair shops quote higher prices to callers who cite a higher benchmark price and that women are quoted higher prices than men when callers signal that they are uninformed about market prices. however, gender differences disappear when callers mention a benchmark price for the repair. finally, the authors find that repair shops are more likely to offer a price concession if asked to do so by a woman than if asked by a man.",1
"product usage experiences have a significant impact on postpurchase evaluation and subsequent behavior. consumers look to their own experiences, as well as those of others, when deciding what to buy and what to recommend. contrary to the intuition that varied experiences should enhance evaluation, five studies demonstrate that in some situations, perceiving usage experiences as less-not more-varied improves postpurchase product evaluation. less varied usage experiences make consumers think that products are used more frequently. as a result, perceiving usage experiences as less varied makes consumers more satisfied with their purchase, more likely to buy it again, and more likely to recommend it. in addition to their practical implications, the findings make important theoretical contributions to the variety literature and toward understanding frequency and numerosity judgments.",0
"this article investigates the in-flight marketplace, using detailed data of in-flight purchases to understand social effects in purchase behavior and determine their potential for designing marketing promotions. on average, a passenger is approximately 30% more likely to buy an item after being exposed to a lateral purchase. analyses on the underlying mechanisms reveal that the classical social influence theories do not suffice to explain all the patterns in the data. the author proposes omission neglect, product contagion, and goal balancing as complementary theories. finally, consumers' willingness to buy is shown to be positively correlated with responsiveness to social influence. this finding indicates that homophily and social feedback effects-classically viewed in the literature as nuisances-can provide targeting value for the firm. by taking these factors into account during behavior-based targeting, firms can double the social spillovers of marketing actions.",0
"consumers face many options that are presented to them as bargains, but in reality, they only subjectively construe a fraction of them as valuable. the authors propose that consumers are particularly attracted to offers they perceive as more valuable than the marketer presumably intended. consistent with this analysis, six experiments indicate that consumers may perceive customized offers that are presented as tailored to their individual preferences or circumstances as less valuable than offers that seem to fit their preferences and provide value without the marketer explicit intent. the experiments also suggest that the urge to exploit unintended value reflects a competitive desire to outsmart the market. the findings have theoretical implications for understanding consumers' subjective perceptions of value as well as important practical implications for designing customized offers and targeted promotions.",0
"four studies investigate the interactive influence of the presence of an accompanying friend and a consumer's agency communion orientation on the consumer's spending behaviors. in general, the authors find that shopping with a friend can be expensive for agency-oriented consumers (e.g., males) but not for communion-oriented consumers (e.g., females). that is, consumers who are agency oriented spend significantly more when they shop with a friend (vs. when they shop alone), whereas this effect is attenuated for consumers who are communion oriented. the results also show that this interactive effect is moderated by individual differences in self-monitoring such that friends are especially influential for consumers who are high in self-monitoring, but the effects occur in opposite directions for agency- and communion-oriented consumers (i.e., agentic consumers spend more with a friend, while communal consumers spend less when accompanied by a friend). finally, the authors test the underlying process and document that the interaction of agency communion orientation, the presence of a friend, and self-monitoring is reversed when the focal context is changed from ""spending for the self"" to ""donating to a charity."" they conclude with a discussion of implications for research and practice.",0
"should intimates respond to their interpersonal mistakes with self-criticism or with self-compassion? although it is reasonable to expect self-compassion to benefit relationships by promoting self-esteem, it is also reasonable to expect self-compassion to hurt relationships by removing intimates' motivation to correct their interpersonal mistakes. two correlational studies, 1 experiment, and 1 longitudinal study demonstrated that whether self-compassion helps or hurts relationships depends on the presence versus absence of dispositional sources of the motivation to correct interpersonal mistakes. among men, the implications of self-compassion were moderated by conscientiousness. among men high in conscientiousness, self-compassion was associated with greater motivation to correct interpersonal mistakes (studies 1 and 3), observations of more constructive problem-solving behaviors (study 2), reports of more accommodation (study 3), and fewer declines in marital satisfaction that were mediated by decreases in interpersonal problem severity (study 4); among men low in conscientiousness, self-compassion was associated with these outcomes in the opposite direction. among women, in contrast, likely because women are inherently more motivated than men to preserve their relationships for cultural and/or biological reasons, self-compassion was never harmful to the relationship. instead, women's self-compassion was positively associated with the motivation to correct their interpersonal mistakes (study 1) and changes in relationship satisfaction (study 4), regardless of conscientiousness. accordingly, theoretical descriptions of the implications of self-promoting thoughts for relationships may be most complete to the extent that they consider the presence versus absence of other sources of the motivation to correct interpersonal mistakes.",0
"the cups (culture x person x situation) approach attempts to jointly consider culture and individual differences, without treating either as noise and without reducing one to the other. culture is important because it helps define psychological situations and create meaningful clusters of behavior according to particular logics. individual differences are important because individuals vary in the extent to which they endorse or reject a culture's ideals. further, because different cultures are organized by different logics, individual differences mean something different in each. central to these studies are concepts of honor-related violence and individual worth as being inalienable versus socially conferred. we illustrate our argument with 2 experiments involving participants from honor, face, and dignity cultures. the studies showed that the same ""type"" of person who was most helpful, honest, and likely to behave with integrity in one culture was the ""type"" of person least likely to do so in another culture. we discuss how cups can provide a rudimentary but integrated approach to understanding both within- and between-culture variation.",0
results from 4 experiments demonstrate that learning the other group members' preferences at the beginning of a discussion impedes the solution of hidden profiles in experiments 1-3. participants who were not informed about their fellow group members' preferences were more likely to solve a hidden profile than those who received bogus information about the others' preferences the negative effect of learning the others' preferences on decision quality was mediated by participants paying less attention to the information exchanged when they had been made aware of the others' preferences experiments 1 and 2 further ruled out that the effect of learn no the others' preferences is clue to participants bolstering their position or due to an increase in informational load experiment 3 showed that learning the other group members' preferences impedes the solution of hidden profiles even it one of the other members favors the correct alternative finally. experiment 4 replicated these results in face-to-face interacting 3-person groups,0
"this article tests competing mechanisms explaining linkages between parent-child educational similarity and parental advice and interest to adult children, asking whether mechanisms differ for mothers and fathers. educational similarities might provide common ground whereas educational dissimilarity affects parents' authority to dispense advice. using ordered logistic regression with data from the netherlands kinship panel study (n = 2,444) parental advice and interest are modeled separately for mothers and fathers. seemingly unrelated estimation is used to test for gender differences across models, revealing that mechanisms driving parental support differ by parents' gender. fathers show more interest in adult children when they are educationally similar (consistent with the homophily hypothesis), but only among the highly educated, whereas mothers show more interest to highly educated children, regardless of their own level of educational attainment. fathers' advice is conditioned on their own educational attainment whereas mothers give advice unconditionally (consistent with the gender hypothesis).",1
"using data from the fragile families and child wellbeing study, we examined whether mothers' (n = 4,127) and fathers' (n = 3,405) relationship status influenced their activation of financial support from relatives over time. we found that relationship status influenced the activation of financial support from relatives but that the effects differed somewhat by gender. mothers were significantly more likely to activate financial assistance if they did not reside with the focal father, whereas fathers had lower odds of activating support if they were no longer in a relationship with the mother. thus, the need for assistance may encourage mothers to access support; fathers may be less likely to access support when they deviate from social norms.",1
"despite the positive societal implications of corporate social responsibility (csr), there remains an extensive debate regarding its consequences for firm shareholders. this study posits that marketing capability plays a complementary role in the csr-shareholder wealth relationship. it further argues that the influence of marketing capability will be higher for csr types with verifiable benefits to firm stakeholders (i.e., consumers, employees, channel partners, and regulators). an analysis utilizing secondary information for a large sample of 1,725 firms for the years 2000-2009 indicates that the effects of overallcsrefforts on stock returns and idiosyncratic risk are not significant on their own but only become so in the presence of marketing capability. furthermore, the results reveal that although marketing capability has positive interaction effects with verifiable csr efforts-environment (e.g., using clean energy), products (e.g., providing to economically disadvantaged), diversity (e.g., pursuing diversity in top management), corporate governance (e.g., limiting board compensation), and employees (e.g., supporting unions)-on stock returns (and negative interaction effects with these csr efforts on idiosyncratic risk), it has no significant interaction effect with community-based efforts (e.g., charitable giving).",1
"hostility and chronic stress are known risk factors for heart disease, but they are costly to assess on a large scale. we used language expressed on twitter to characterize community-level psychological correlates of age-adjusted mortality from atherosclerotic heart disease (ahd). language patterns reflecting negative social relationships, disengagement, and negative emotionsespecially angeremerged as risk factors; positive emotions and psychological engagement emerged as protective factors. most correlations remained significant after controlling for income and education. a cross-sectional regression model based only on twitter language predicted ahd mortality significantly better than did a model that combined 10 common demographic, socioeconomic, and health risk factors, including smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. capturing community psychological characteristics through social media is feasible, and these characteristics are strong markers of cardiovascular mortality at the community level.",1
"specialized, bimodal neural systems integrate visual and tactile information in the space near the hand. here, we show that visuo-tactile representations allow attention to influence early perceptual processing, namely, figure-ground assignment. regions that were reached toward were more likely than other regions to be assigned as foreground figures, and hand position competed with image-based information to bias figure-ground assignment. our findings suggest that hand position allows attention to influence visual perceptual processing and that visual processes typically viewed as unimodal can be influenced by bimodal visuo-tactile representations.",0
"the authors empirically explore how consumers update beliefs about a store's overall expensiveness. they estimate a learning model of store price image (spi) formation with the impact of actual prices linked to category characteristics on a unique data set combining consumers' store visit and purchase information with their price perceptions. the results identify characteristics that drive categories' store price signaling power for different store formats. ""big ticket"" categories with a narrow price range strongly shape consumers' store price beliefs, whereas (volatile) prices of frequently or deeply promoted categories are less influential. at traditional supermarkets, consumers anchor and elaborate on prices of storable categories bought in large quantities and for which quality differentiation is high. for hard discounters, however, spi is mostly shaped by frequently bought categories with narrow assortments. notably, categories' spi signaling power is not proportional to their share of wallet at either type of chain. managers can use these results to identify ""lighthouse"" categories that signal low prices, yet make up a small portion of store spending, and in which price cuts do not overly hurt revenue.",1
"many firms attempt to enhance experience consumption by facilitating the consumption outcome (i.e., the end state achieved, such as the final score of a basketball game) and the consumption process (i.e., the course through which the end is achieved, such as how the game is played). the authors propose that the roles of outcome and process in the evaluation of experience consumption are dependent not only on consumers' role in the experience (participant vs. spectator) but also on their self-construal (independent vs. interdependent). as a spectator (e.g., watching a game), independents' (vs. interdependents') experience consumption evaluations are more likely to be influenced by outcome, while interdependent (vs. independent) consumers are more likely to be affected by process. the reverse is true when consumers assume the role of a participant in the experience (e.g., playing a game). the authors' theorizing is supported across three studies.",0
"firms frequently compete across multiple segments. such multimarket contact has been shown to deter aggressive competition, leading to ""mutual forbearance."" empirical support for this phenomenon derives mainly from studies on the direct effects of multimarket contact on a firm's decision variables. the analysis in this article extends the existing literature by empirically considering both the direct effects of multimarket contact (i.e., how it affects a firm's decision variables) and its strategic effects (i.e., how it affects a firm's reactions to its competitors' decision variables). the authors study the pricing and new product introduction decisions of firms in the personal computer industry. consistent with prior research, the authors find that firms mutually forbear in price and new product introductions. more important, the authors find strong strategic effects that are asymmetric; namely, firms respond to competitive attacks by introducing new products but do not use price as a retaliatory weapon. thus, firms isolate any competitive retaliation to only a single marketing variable. the results offer a deeper understanding of the influence of multimarket contact on firm behavior.",1
"this article examines a silver lining of standing in line: consumers infer that products are more valuable when others are behind them. specifically, the value of a product increases as more people line up behind a person (study 1) and when others are present (versus absent) behind a person in line (study 2). value increases further when directing consumers' attention to the presence of others behind them-that is, when they look backward versus forward (study 3) and when the queue structure emphasizes the last person to join rather than the person being served (study 4). this effect of people in line behind them is associated with increased expenditures by queuing consumers (study 5).",0
"language non-selective lexical access in bilinguals has been established mainly using tasks requiring explicit language processing. here, we show that bilinguals activate native language translations even when words presented in their second language are incidentally processed in a nonverbal, visual search task. chinese-english bilinguals searched for strings of circles or squares presented together with three english words (i.e., distracters) within a 4-item grid. in the experimental trials, all four locations were occupied by english words, including a critical word that phonologically overlapped with the chinese word for circle or square when translated into chinese. the eye-tracking results show that, in the experimental trials, bilinguals looked more frequently and longer at critical than control words, a pattern that was absent in english monolingual controls. we conclude that incidental word processing activates lexical representations of both languages of bilinguals, even when the task does not require explicit language processing.

"perception of intersensory temporal order is particularly difficult for (continuous) audiovisual speech, as perceivers may find it difficult to notice substantial timing differences between speech sounds and lip movements. here we tested whether this occurs because audiovisual speech is strongly paired (""unity assumption""). participants made temporal order judgments (toj) and simultaneity judgments (sj) about sine-wave speech (sws) replicas of pseudowords and the corresponding video of the face. listeners in speech and non-speech mode were equally sensitive judging audiovisual temporal order. yet, using the mcgurk effect, we could demonstrate that the sound was more likely integrated with lipread speech if heard as speech than non-speech. judging temporal order in audiovisual speech is thus unaffected by whether the auditory and visual streams are paired. conceivably, previously found differences between speech and non-speech stimuli are not due to the putative ""special"" nature of speech, but rather reflect low-level stimulus differences.

"patron-client networks are widely found in governments of transitional societies and are often seen as an impediment to effective governance. this article advances an alternative view that emphasizes their enabling effects. i argue that patron-client relations can be used to improve government performance by resolving principal-agent problems within political hierarchies. i substantiate this claim by examining how patronage networks shape economic performance of local governments in china. using an original city-level panel data set between 2000 and 2011, and a new method that identifies patronage ties based on past promotions, i show that city leaders with informal ties to the incumbent provincial leaders deliver significantly faster economic growth than those without. i conduct additional analyses to rule out several important alternative explanations and provide evidence on the incentive-enhancing mechanism. these findings highlight the importance of informal institutions for bureaucratic management and authoritarian governance.",1
"governments are absent from empirical studies of civil violence, except as static sources of grievance. the influence that government policy accommodations and threats of repression have on internal violence is difficult to verify without a means to identify potential militancy that did not happen. i use a within-country research design to address this problem. during india's reorganization as a linguistic federation, every language group could have sought a state. i show that representation in the ruling party conditioned the likelihood of a violent statehood movement. prostatehood groups that were politically advantaged over the interests opposed to them were peacefully accommodated. statehood movements similar in political importance to their opponents used violence. very politically disadvantaged groups refrained from mobilization, anticipating repression. these results call into question the search for a monotonic relationship between grievances and violence and the omission of domestic politics from prominent theories of civil conflict.",1
"the common wisdom in journalistic accounts of earmarking is that congress distributes earmarks on a purely political basis, without any consideration for the demand for federal spending. academic accounts similarly argue that factors internal to congress are preeminent in determining where earmarks go, even more than for other types of pork-barrel spending using earmarks appearing in the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bills, i search for both chamber-based and demand-side determinants of the distribution of earmarks. i find that both types of factors are significantly related to the number of earmarks that a house member receives this result indicates that even while earmarking, members of congress are at least minimally responsive to voter preferences and calls into question whether earmarks should be treated as an outlier within the universe of spending allocation mechanisms.",1
tins article seeks to improve our understanding of policy institutions and cooperation by adapting long's (1958) analysis of the ecology of games to the context of collaborative land use and transportation planning in california the traditional institutional rational choice analysis argues that collaborative institutions reduce the transaction costs of cooperation among multiple policy actors. the ecology of games framework extends irc by emphasizing the consequences of multiple institutions and identifies several reasons why collaborative institutions may actually reduce the amount of cooperation in existing policy venues. analyses of survey data from policy actors in five california regions demonstrate that higher levels of cooperation in collaborative institutions are associated with lower levels of cooperation in other land-use and transportation planning institutions,1
"the original studies of ""competitive authoritarianism"" and ""hegemonic authoritarianism"" inspected the occurrence of hybrid regimes during the 1990s but stopped short of testing their propensity for democratic change. this article assesses the causal effects of hybrid regimes, and the post-cold war period itself, on regime breakdown and democratization. using a dataset of 158 regimes from 1975 to 2004, and a discrete measure for transitions to electoral democracy, i find that competitive authoritarian regimes are not especially prone to losing power but are significantly more likely to be followed by electoral democracy: vigorous electoral contestation does not independently subvert authoritarianism, yet it bodes well for democratic prospects once incumbents are overthrown.",1
"i combine a regression discontinuity design with rich data on academic and labor market outcomes for a large sample of florida students to estimate the returns to college admission for academically marginal students. students with grades just above a threshold for admissions eligibility at a large public university in florida are much more likely to attend any university than below-threshold students. the marginal admission yields earnings gains of 22% between 8 and 14 years after high school completion. these gains outstrip the costs of college attendance, and they are largest for male students and free-lunch recipients.",1
"in business-to-business markets, hunting for new customers and farming existing customers are critical to achieve sales goals. although practitioners suggest that salespeople have a preference for either hunting or farming, academic research has yet to examine when and why salespeople become oriented toward hunting or farming, and whether a simultaneous engagement in both (i.e., being ambidextrous) is efficient or damaging. in study 1, the authors identify the link between regulatory focus and salesperson hunting and farming orientations. in study 2, they demonstrate that (1) a promotion (prevention) focus is more strongly related to salesperson hunting (farming) orientation than is a prevention (promotion) focus, and (2) ambidextrous salespeople generate higher profits when they are customer oriented. in study 3, the authors show that salesperson expectations about hunting success and the extent to which compensation plans are based on customer acquisition activities can change the direction of the relationship between regulatory focus and salesperson hunting and farming orientations. the authors discuss the implications of these findings for research and management of customer acquisition and retention at the salesperson level.",0
"perceivers' inferences about individuals based on their faces often show high interrater consensus and can even accurately predict behavior in some domains. here we investigated the consensus and accuracy of judgments of trustworthiness. in study 1, we showed that the type of photo judged makes a significant difference for whether an individual is judged as trustworthy. in study 2, we found that inferences of trustworthiness made from the faces of corporate criminals did not differ from inferences made from the faces of noncriminal executives. in study 3, we found that judgments of trustworthiness did not differ between the faces of military criminals and the faces of military heroes. in study 4, we tempted undergraduates to cheat on a test. although we found that judgments of intelligence from the students' faces were related to students' scores on the test and that judgments of students' extraversion were correlated with self-reported extraversion, there was no relationship between judgments of trustworthiness from the students' faces and students' cheating behavior. finally, in study 5, we examined the neural correlates of the accuracy of judgments of trustworthiness from faces. replicating previous research, we found that perceptions of trustworthiness from the faces in study 4 corresponded to participants' amygdala response. however, we found no relationship between the amygdala response and the targets' actual cheating behavior. these data suggest that judgments of trustworthiness may not be accurate but, rather, reflect subjective impressions for which people show high agreement.",0
"integrating family and child data from the early childhood longitudinal study-birth cohort with contextual data from the census, this study examined associations among maternal employment, aspects of communities related to child-care supply and demand, and the early care and education arrangements of 4year olds in mexican-origin, black, and white families. children with employed mothers were more likely to be in informal care arrangements than in early childhood education, regardless of racial/ethnic background. for children in mexican-origin families, selection into informal care over early childhood education was more likely in zip codes with greater demand for care as measured by higher female employment. utilization of parent care versus early childhood education was also more likely for children in mexican-origin and black families in zip codes with higher female employment. constraints associated with maternal employment thus hindered children from enrolling in early childhood education, and community contexts posed challenges for some groups.",1
"repartnering has been linked to health benefits for mothers, yet few studies have examined relationship quality in this context. according to the divorce-stress-adaptation perspective, relationship quality may influence the relationship between maternal well-being and dating after divorce. the current study examines the consequences of dating, relationship quality, and dating transitions (breaking up and dating new partners) on maternal well-being (negative affect and life satisfaction). using monthly surveys completed by mothers over a 2-year period after filing for divorce, we examined changes in intercepts and slopes of dating status and transitions for maternal well-being while also testing the effects of relationship quality. mothers entering high-quality relationships were likely to report boosts in well-being at relationship initiation compared to single mothers and mothers entering low-quality relationships. mothers entering lower-quality relationships were likely to report lower levels of well-being than single mothers. dating transitions were associated with increases in well-being. implications for maternal adjustment are discussed.",1
"data from the 1979 national longitudinal survey of youth were employed to explore the association between boomerang fathering from birth to age 18 on adolescent depressive symptomatology (n = 3,731). we examined the effects of experiencing a biological father exiting and entering the home because of breaking up and repartnering with an adolescent's mother (i.e., boomerang fathering) when compared with other father residential patterns on adolescent depression. findings suggest that boomerang fathering is more beneficial than harmful. adolescent females exposed to boomerang fathering, as well as those exposed to fathers who resided with them from birth to age 18, reported significantly lower depressive symptoms when compared with females exposed to fathers who exited the household and never returned. boomerang fathering was not significantly associated with male adolescent depressive symptomatology. providing greater family support during times of instability may assist in unifying families and be an indirect source of mental health prevention.",1
"this study investigated the common assumption that measures of father involvement are invariant across child age, gender, and reporter. measurement invariance was tested with 320 families who were interviewed at child ages 10, 12, and 14. criterion validity was also examined, using observational, survey, and physiologic measures with factor rotation type considered. it was found that invariance did not hold across gender for child report but did hold for mother and father reports. differing factors were found across time and reporter. child report and orthogonally rotated solutions demonstrated the greatest criterion validity. the findings suggest that typical father involvement assumptions may not hold and, when this is the case, involvement should be conceptualized in light of varying involvement domains. implications for conceptualizing and analytically examining father involvement are considered.",0
"family scholars have focused on the onset of sexual activity early in the life course, but little is known about the cessation of sexual activity in relationships in later life. we use event-history analysis techniques and logistic regression to identify the correlates of sexual inactivity among older married men and women. we analyze data for 1,502 married people from the national social life, health, and aging project, a nationally representative sample of 3,005 noninstitutionalized american men and women ages 57 to 85. we find 29% of the married persons report no sexual activity for the previous 12 months or more. relationship duration, chronological age, and poor physical health are all independently associated with sexual inactivity. characteristics such as marital happiness, premarital cohabitation, and remarriage are also associated with levels of inactivity or activity. analyses also point to gender differences in the correlates of sexual inactivity.",1
"the analyses described in this article investigated the association between adolescent fertility expectations and college enrollment (n = 7,838). they also explored the potential impact of fertility expectations and events on college persistence among 4-year (n = 2,605) and 2-year (n = 1,962) college students. the analysis, which used data from the national longitudinal survey of youth 1997 cohort, showed a significant association between expectations for early parenthood and the likelihood of going to a 4-year college or 2-year college for both men and women. in addition, the authors found that pregnancies were associated with an increased risk of college dropout for women; however, if all of the estimated effect of pregnancies on the risk of dropout were causal, they would still not be a major factor contributing to educational attainment because fertile pregnancies among college women are so rare.",1
"certain features of language, such as accent, are acquired from the local social environment during an acquisition period starting at infancy and ending roughly at puberty. if the scale of social interaction expands after puberty, humans will encounter variance in these linguistic features, and the linguistic similarity between people will indicate the degree to which they share a common early social history. there is reason to believe that such a dynamic is not a modern phenomenon, but has likely occurred throughout our species' evolutionary history since the advent of language. consequently, the human mind may contain systems for categorizing others according to their linguistic repertoires, including their accents. four studies demonstrate that (i) accent differences-both native versus non-native accents and also two different non-native accents, are the basis of spontaneous and implicit social categorization, and (ii) this is not driven by general acoustic-differences, low level sound differences, or differences in familiarity or ease-of-processing. results are consistent with the hypothesis that human mind contains systems for categorizing others according to their accents.

"we investigated the ecology and evolution of interspecific cooperation between the greater honeyguide bird, indicator indicator, and human hunter-gatherers, the hadza of northern tanzania. we found that honeyguides increased the hadza's rate of finding bee nests by 560%, and that the birds led men to significantly higher yielding nests than those found without honeyguides. we estimate that 8-10% of the hadza's total diet was acquired with the help of honeyguides. contrary to most depictions of the human-honeyguide relationship, the hadza did not actively repay honeyguides, but instead, hid, buried, and burned honeycomb, with the intent of keeping the bird hungry and thus more likely to guide again. such manipulative behavior attests to the importance of social intelligence in hunter-gatherer foraging strategies. we present an evolutionary model for human-honeyguide interactions guided by the behavioral ecology of bees, non-human primates, and hunter-gatherers.

"the behavioral immune system (bis) is a cluster of psychological mechanisms (e.g., disgust) that have evolved to promote disease-avoidance (schaller m. (2006). parasites, behavioral defenses, and the social psychological mechanisms through which cultures are evoked. psychological inquiry, 17, 96-101). recent evidence suggests that the bis may promote avoidance of outgroup members, an historical source of contamination, by evoking social conservatism (terrizzi ja jr, shook nj, 82 ventis wl. (2010). disgust: a predictor of social conservatism and prejudicial attitudes toward homosexuals. personality and individual differences, 49, 587-592; terrizzi j, shook n, ventis l (2012). religious conservatism: an evolutionarily evoked disease-avoidance strategy. religion, brain & behavior, 2, 105-120.). that is, the bis mechanisms may encourage the endorsement of socially conservative beliefs, which promote social exclusivity, tradition, and negativity toward outgroups. the current study provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of 24 studies to evaluate the hypothesis that the bis is predictive of social conservatism. the results indicate that behavioral immune strength, as indicated by fear of contamination and disgust sensitivity, is positively related to social conservatism (i.e., right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, religious fundamentalism, ethnocentrism, collectivism, and political conservatism). these findings provide initial evidence that socially conservative values may function as evolutionarily evoked disease-avoidance strategies.

"there is reason to suspect that lower levels of exposure to criminogenic peer-based risks help explain why immigrant youth are less involved in crime and violence. however, it also is possible that if and when they do encounter these risks, immigrant youth are more vulnerable to them than are native-born youth. drawing from literature on the adaptation experiences of immigrant adolescents, we hypothesize that immigrant youth will be relatively more susceptible to the effects of both 1) exposure to deviant peers and 2) unstructured and unsupervised socializing with peers when compared with their nonimmigrant counterparts. using a sample of approximately 1,800 adolescents from the project on human development in chicago neighborhoods (phdcn) study, we find support for our first hypothesis but not the second. specifically, in both cross-sectional and longitudinal models, we find that exposure to deviant peers has a greater impact on violence among immigrant youth than it does for native-born youth. furthermore, this pattern of results is supported with supplemental, sensitivity analysis using the addhealth data. in contrast, there are no statistically significant differences across immigrant generation status with regard to the effect of informal socializing with peers on violence.",1
"it has been hypothesized that humans are able to track other's mental states efficiently and without being conscious of doing so using their implicit theory of mind (itom) system. however, while itom appears to operate unconsciously recent work suggests it does draw on executive attentional resources (schneider, lam, bayliss, 82 dux, 2012) bringing into question whether itom is engaged efficiently. here, we examined other aspects relating to automatic processing: the extent to which the operation of itom is controllable and how it is influenced by beavioral intentions. this was implemented by assessing how task instructions affect eye-movement patterns in a sally-anne false-belief task. one group of subjects was given no task instructions (no instructions), another overtly judged the location of a ball a protagonist interacted with (ball tracking) and a third indicated the location consistent with the actor's belief about the ball's location (belief tracking). despite different task goals, all groups' eye-movement patterns were consistent with belief analysis, and the no instructions and ball tracking groups reported no explicit mentalizing when debriefed. these findings represent definitive evidence that humans implicitly track the belief states of others in an uncontrollable and unintentional manner.

"unelected officials with coercive powers (e.g., police, prosecutors, bureaucrats) vary markedly in the extent to which citizens view their actions as legitimate. we explore the institutional determinants of legitimate authority in the context of a public goods laboratory experiment. in the experiment, an authority can target one citizen for punishment following citizen contribution choices. untargeted citizens can then choose to help or hinder the authority. this latter choice may be interpreted as a behavioral measure of the authority's legitimacy. we find that legitimacy is affected by how authorities are compensated, the transparency with which their decisions are observed, and an interaction between these. when transparency is high, citizens are more willing to assist authorities who receive fixed salaries than those who personally benefit from collected penalties, even when citizens' material incentives are controlled for. lower transparency reduces support, but only for salaried enforcers.",1
"this paper provides new evidence of gender differences in response to increased competition, focusing on important life tasks performed in a regular social environment. the analysis takes advantage of a major education reform in ontario that exogenously increased competition for university grades. comparing students prereform and postreform using rich administrative data, i find that male average grades and the proportion of male students graduating ""on time"" increased relative to females. further, the evidence indicates that these changes were due to increased relative effort rather than self-selection. the findings have implications for the delivery of education and incentive provision more generally.",1
"promotions play an important role for the provision of incentives in firms. we analyze incentives in multistage elimination tournaments with controlled laboratory experiments. in our two main treatments, we compare a two-stage tournament to a one-stage tournament. subjects in the two-stage treatment provide excess effort in the first stage, both with respect to nash predictions and compared to the strategically equivalent one-stage tournament. additional control treatments confirm that excess effort in early stages is a robust finding and suggest that above-equilibrium effort might be driven by limited degrees of forward-looking behavior and subjects deriving nonmonetary value from competing.",0
"this article uses short-run housing wealth changes to identify the effect of housing wealth on college attendance. i find that households used their housing wealth to finance postsecondary enrollment in the 2000s when housing wealth was most liquid; each $10,000 in home equity raises college enrollment by 0.7 of a percentage point on average. the effect is localized to lower-resource families, for whom a $10,000 increase in housing wealth increases enrollment by 5.7 percentage points. these estimates imply that the recent housing bust could significantly negatively affect college enrollment through reduction in the housing wealth of families with college-age children.",1
"previous studies have demonstrated that european americans have fewer mixed affective experiences (i.e., are less likely to experience the bad with the good) compared with chinese. in this article, we argue that these cultural differences are due to ""ideal affect,"" or how people ideally want to feel. specifically, we predict that people from individualistic cultures want to maximize positive and minimize negative affect more than people from collectivistic cultures, and as a result, they are less likely to actually experience mixed emotions (reflected by a more negative within-person correlation between actual positive and negative affect). we find support for this prediction in 2 experience sampling studies conducted in the united states and china (studies 1 and 2). in addition, we demonstrate that ideal affect is a distinct construct from dialectical view of the self, which has also been related to mixed affective experience (study 3). finally, in study 4, we demonstrate that experimentally manipulating the desire to maximize the positive and minimize the negative alters participants' actual experience of mixed emotions during a pleasant (but not unpleasant or combined pleasant and unpleasant) tv clip in the united states and hong kong. together, these findings suggest that across cultures, how people want to feel shapes how they actually feel, particularly people's experiences of mixed affect.",0
"guided by the ideal standards model (simpson, fletcher, & campbell, 2001), the present research investigated the emotional and regulatory consequences of different forms of perceived partner discrepancies in a relationship context studies 1 (dating sample) and 2 (married sample) demonstrated that perceiving one's partner to be the source of a partner discrepancy (i.e., a pd-partner) was associated with dejection emotions, whereas perceiving oneself to be the source of the partner discrepancy (i.e., a pd-self) was associated with agitation emotions. study 3 provided experimental support for the findings of studies 1 and 2 by demonstrating that participants primed with either a pd-partner or a pd-self exhibited facilitated responses to dejection and agitation emotions, respectively. studies 4 and 5 provided experimental support for the prediction that a pd-partner also results in a promotion focus regulatory style, whereas a pd-self results in a prevention focus regulatory style. the importance of understanding the emotional and regulatory ramifications of evaluation outcomes within a romantic relationship context is discussed.",0
"economists and psychologists have developed a variety of models to explain human behavior in the ultimatum game, but none can adequately account for all of the available data. across two studies using a face perception paradigm, we provide evidence that people use evolved, specialized heuristics for long-term cooperative partner choice to calibrate their generosity toward ultimatum game partners. men and women played one-shot ultimatum games for real incentives with partners represented by face photographs. men were more generous toward partners who were stronger, and who appeared more attractive, more prosocial, more productive, healthier and higher in social status; the effect of strength was mediated by productivity, but not dangerousness, suggesting that men implemented heuristics designed for partner choice rather than the asymmetric war of attrition. moreover, men reduced their earnings by cooperating selectively with valuable long-term partners. women also gave better treatment to valuable-appearing partners, but appeared to prioritize partner choice less than men did, relative to game earnings and intrasexual competition. the results suggest that people treat the ultimatum game as though it were an opportunity to establish a cooperative relationship with a new partner, and implications are discussed for an evolved psychology of cooperative partner choice.

"much attractiveness research has focused on face shape. the role of masculinity (which for adults is thought to be a relatively stable shape cue to developmental testosterone levels) in male facial attractiveness has been examined, with mixed results. recent work on the perception of skin color (a more variable cue to current health status) indicates that increased skin redness, yellowness, and lightness enhance apparent health. it has been suggested that stable cues such as masculinity may be less important to attractiveness judgments than short-term, more variable health cues. we examined associations between male facial attractiveness, masculinity, and skin color in african and caucasian populations. masculinity was not found to be associated with attractiveness in either ethnic group. however, skin color was found to be an important predictor of attractiveness judgments, particularly for own-ethnicity faces. our results suggest that more plastic health cues, such as skin color, are more important than developmental cues such as masculinity. further, unfamiliarity with natural skin color variation in other ethnic groups may limit observers' ability to utilize these color cues.

"the study tested the proposition that relationship involvement influences the implicit responses of women to high- and low-status professions. it was hypothesized that when a high-involvement context was primed, women would have more positive implicit associations with high-status occupations than when a low-involvement context was primed. in contrast, when a high-involvement context was primed, women would have more negative associations with low-status occupations than when a low-involvement context was primed. to test the hypothesis, 123 female participants received a high or low relationship involvement prime. then the participants completed a single category implicit associations test designed to measure the participants' associations with either high- or low-status occupations. as predicted, the relationship involvement prime influenced the positivity of associations made with high- and low-status occupations. the study pointed to the possibility that persons possess evolutionary-based implicit associations.

"explanations for the fact that crime tends to run in families have focused on the deprived social backgrounds of criminal parents, methods of child-rearing, modeling processes, and genetic mechanisms. however, parental involvement in the criminal justice system itself also might contribute to the intergenerational transmission of crime and have other adverse effects on children's well-being. we investigated the development of youth problem behavior in relation to parental arrest, conviction, and incarceration in the youngest and oldest samples of the pittsburgh youth study, a longitudinal survey of 1,009 inner-city boys. parental arrest and conviction without incarceration did not predict the development of youth problem behavior. parental incarceration was not associated with increases in marijuana use, depression, or poor academic performance. however, boys experiencing parental incarceration showed greater increases in theft compared with a control group matched on propensity scores. the association between parental incarceration and youth theft was stronger for white youth than for black youth. parenting and peer relations after parental incarceration explained about half of its effects on youth theft. because the effects of parental incarceration were specific to youth theft, labeling and stigma processes might be particularly important for understanding the consequences of parental incarceration for children.",1
"empirical investigations of criminal sentencing represent a vast research enterprise in criminology. however, this research has been restricted almost exclusively to u.s. contexts, and often it suffers from key data limitations. as such, an examination of more detailed international sentencing data provides an important opportunity to assess the generalizability of contemporary research and theorizing on criminal punishment in the united states. the current study investigates little-researched questions about the influence of prosecutorial sentencing recommendations, victim/offender relationships, and extralegal disparities in sentencing by analyzing unique data on the punishment of homicide offenders in the netherlands. the results indicate that offender, victim, and situational offense characteristics all exert important independent effects at sentencing and that prosecutorial recommendations exert powerful influences over judicial sentences. the article concludes with a discussion of future directions for comparative sentencing research across international contexts.",1
"conspicuous consumption may be explained by the need to signal higher social status in a society. however, whether this consumption actually translates to improved perception of well-being remains unexamined. in the emerging economy context, we argue that conspicuous consumption may play the role of elevating ones own perception of economic well-being. further we hypothesize the effect to be higher for the households in the 'bottom of the pyramid' (bop). using data from a panel of 34,621 households from india human development surveys (2004 and 2011), we examine the relationship between conspicuous consumption and subjective economic well-being (sews) using several empirical strategies. results support our hypotheses that higher conspicuous consumption may result in improved sewb and that the effect is higher for households in the bop. our findings contribute to the domain of conspicuous consumption and bop in emerging markets. further, our results have significant marketing and policy implications.",0
"how can states signal their alliance commitments? although scholars have developed sophisticated theoretical models of costly signaling in international relations, we know little about which specific policies leaders can implement to signal their commitments. this article addresses this question with respect to the extended deterrent effects of nuclear weapons. can nuclear states deter attacks against their friends by simply announcing their defense commitments? or must they deploy nuclear weapons on a protege's territory before an alliance is seen as credible? using a new dataset on foreign nuclear deployments from 1950 to 2000, our analysis reveals two main findings. first, formal alliances with nuclear states appear to carry significant deterrence benefits. second, however, stationing nuclear weapons on a protege's territory does not bolster these effects. the analysis yields new insights about the dynamics of hand-tying and sunk cost signals in international politics.",1

"in the 1980s, many us cities initiated programs reserving a proportion of government contracts for minority-owned businesses. the staggered introduction of these set-aside programs is used to estimate their impacts on the self-employment and employment rates of african american men. black business ownership rates increased significantly after program initiation, with the black-white gap falling 3 percentage points. the evidence that the racial gap in employment also fell is less clear as it depends on assumptions about the continuation of preexisting trends. the black gains were concentrated in industries heavily affected by set-asides, and they mostly benefited the better educated.",1
"using data for students undertaking a series of real-world academic examinations with high future payoffs, we examine whether the differences in these evaluations' competitive nature generate a performance gender gap. in the univariate setting we find that women's performance is first-order stochastically dominated by that of men when the competition is higher, whereas the reverse holds true in the less competitive or noncompetitive tests. these results are confirmed in the multivariate setting. our findings, from a real-world setting with important payoffs at stake, are in line with the evidence from experimental research that finds that females tend to perform worse in more competitive contexts.",1

"economists generally assume, implicitly, that ""the return to schooling"" is invariant across local labor markets. we demonstrate that this outcome pertains if and only if preferences are homothetic-a special case that seems unlikely. our theory predicts that returns to education will instead be relatively low in expensive high-amenity locations. our analysis of u. s. data provides support for this contention; returns to college are especially low in such cities as san francisco and seattle. our findings call into question standard empirical exercises in labor economics that treat the returns to education as a single parameter.",1
"this article studies the effect of changes in foreign competition on the structure of compensation and incentives of u. s. executives. we find that import penetration (instrumented with exchange rates and tariffs) leads to more incentive provision in a variety of ways. first, it increases the sensitivity of pay to performance. second, it increases within-firm pay differentials between executive levels, with ceos typically experiencing the largest wage increases. finally, higher foreign competition is also associated with a higher demand for talent. these results suggest that increased foreign competition can explain some of the recent trends in compensation structures.",1

"numerous developing countries have substantially increased their number of subnational administrative units in recent years. the literature on this phenomenon is, nonetheless, small and suffers from several theoretical and methodological shortcomings: in particular, a unit of analysis problem that causes past studies to mistakenly de-emphasize the importance of local actors. we posit that administrative unit proliferation occurs where and when there is a confluence of interests between the national executive and local citizens and elites from areas that are politically, economically, and ethnically marginalized. we argue further that although the proliferation of administrative units often accompanies or follows far-reaching decentralization reforms, it likely results in a recentralization of power; the proliferation of new local governments fragments existing units into smaller ones with lower relative intergovernmental bargaining power and administrative capacity. we find support for these arguments using original data from uganda numerous developing countries have substantially increased their number of subnational administrative units in recent years. the literature on this phenomenon is, nonetheless, small and suffers from several theoretical and methodological shortcomings: in particular, a unit of analysis problem that causes past studies to mistakenly de-emphasize the importance of local actors. we posit that administrative unit proliferation occurs where and when there is a confluence of interests between the national executive and local citizens and elites from areas that are politically, economically, and ethnically marginalized. we argue further that although the proliferation of administrative units often accompanies or follows far-reaching decentralization reforms, it likely results in a recentralization of power; the proliferation of new local governments fragments existing units into smaller ones with lower relative intergovernmental bargaining power and administrative capacity. we find support for these arguments using original data from uganda.",1
"we study discrimination against immigrants using microlevel data from switzerland, where, until recently, some municipalities used referendums to decide on the citizenship applications of foreign residents. we show that naturalization decisions vary dramatically with immigrants' attributes, which we collect from official applicant descriptions that voters received before each referendum. country of origin determines naturalization success more than any other applicant characteristic, including language skills, integration status, and economic credentials. the average proportion of ""no"" votes is about 40% higher for applicants from (the former) yugoslavia and turkey compared to observably similar applicants from richer northern and western european countries. statistical and taste-based discrimination contribute to varying naturalization success; the rewards for economic credentials are higher for applicants from disadvantaged origins, and origin-based discrimination is much stronger in more xenophobic municipalities. moreover, discrimination against specific immigrant groups responds dynamically to changes in the groups' relative size.",1
"women's voice pitch (the perceptual correlate of fundamental frequency, f0) varies across the menstrual cycle and lowers after menopause, and may represent a putative signal of women's fertility and reproductive age. yet, despite dramatic changes in women's sex hormone levels and bodies during and after pregnancy, previous between-subject and case studies have not found systematic changes in f0 due to pregnancy. here, we tracked within-individual variation in 20 mothers' voices during their first pregnancy, as well as up to 5 years before conception and 5 years postpartum. voice recordings from 20 age-matched nulliparous women were measured as a control. linear mixed models indicated that f0 mean, range and variation changed significantly following pregnancy in mothers, controlling for age at time of recording, whereas we did not observe any f0 changes across corresponding timeframes in our sample of nulliparous controls. mothers' voices became significantly lower-pitched and more monotonous during the first year postpartum compared to during pregnancy or before. these f0 parameters did not decrease within-individuals over a 5-year period prior to conception above and beyond the effects of ageing. although voice pitch decreased following pregnancy, mothers' f0 parameters reverted after the first year postpartum, approaching pre-pregnancy levels. our results demonstrate that pregnancy has a transient and perceptually salient masculinizing effect on women's voices.",0
"a fundamental challenge to understanding our evolved psychology is to explain how cooperative or prosocial behaviors are maintained despite the immediate temptation to free-ride. we propose that charismatic leadership and followership can be best understood as a product of this recurrent, fitness-relevant selection pressure for adaptations that effectively promoted and sustained prosocial behaviors within groups. we describe charismatic leadership and followership as a dynamic process in which leaders signal their ability to benefit the group by increasing the perceived likelihood that cooperation will succeed. a charismatic leader is one who is able to attract the attention of other group members and serve as a focal point for aligning and synchronizing prosocial orientations in followers, suppressing sensitivity to cooperative risks, and enhancing the salience of perceived cooperative rewards. we hypothesize that exposure to such individuals will activate heuristics causing participants to behave more prosocially. the results of three economic experiments (n = 500) provide behavioral evidence for the ""charismatic prosociality"" hypothesis through the use of the trust, dictator, and stag hunt games.

"humans' social interactions are characterized by a tension between individual-regarding preferences such as others' subjective preferences and group-regarding preferences such as others' group membership. using the dictator game, we demonstrate that this tension characterizes even preschool children's distributive behavior, and that it patterns differently across development and genders. study 1 contrasted ownership of the resource (mine/ours/not mine) with recipients' minimal group membership (in-group/out-group). we found that only boys generated biased distributions favoring the in-group, and preserved common resources as if they were their own. study 2 revealed that upon learning of recipients' personal preferences (like/doesn't like resource), boys and girls complied with in-group members' preferences, but only boys also manifested a behavior that opposed out-group members' preferences. the early emergence of a balance between individual- and group-regarding preferences sheds light on the origins of parochialism, and its gender selectivity is consistent with evolutionary accounts of the origins of group cognition in humans.

"the present paper analyzes the extent to which attractiveness-related variables affect cooperative behavior in women. cooperativeness is evaluated through a prisoner's dilemma game (pdg). we consider several morphometric variables related to attractiveness: fluctuating asymmetry (fa), waist-hip ratio (whr), body mass index (bmi) and facial femininity (ff). these variables have been shown to predict human behavior. we also include as a control variable a score for self-perceived attractiveness (spa). we test differences in these variables according to behavior in the pdg. our results reveal that low-fa women cooperate less frequently in the pdg. we also find that women with lower whr are more cooperative. this result contradicts the expected relation between whr and behavior in the pdg. we show that this effect of whr on cooperation operates through its influence on the expectation that participants hold on the cooperative intent of their counterpart. in addition, we show that the effect of attractive features on cooperation occurs independently of the participants' perception of their own appeal. finally, we discuss our results in the context of the evolution of cooperative behavior and under the hypothesis that attractiveness is a reliable indicator of phenotypic quality.

"consciousness and self-awareness, juxtaposed by the ability to self-deceive, are legacies of our evolutionary heritage. as a purposive outgrowth of modularity, self-deception may serve to isolate threatening thoughts from consciousness and facilitate cooperation. the primary goal of the present investigation was to determine if individuals with depression exhibit both low levels of self-deception and cooperation. relationships between the tendency to self-deceive and the conscious attributions typical of depression or promoting cooperation were also examined. eighty undergraduate participants completed measures of self-deception, impression management, depression, and attributional styles. cooperation was assessed by responses to social dilemmas based on the prisoner's dilemma game. results indicated that, as expected, high self-deceivers cooperated more and exhibited lower levels of depression than low self-deceivers. self-deception scores were significantly associated with several attributional styles but independently predicted depressive symptomology. that individuals with depression displayed both reduced levels of self-deception and cooperation is discussed in light of several models of the evolutionary significance of depression, especially e. h. hagen's bargaining model of depression [the functions of postpartum depression. evolution and human behavior, 20, 325-359, 1999; depression as bargaining: the case postpartum. evolution and human behavior, 23, 323-336, 2002; the bargaining model of expression. in p. hammerstein (ed.), genetic and cultural evolution of cooperation (pp. 95-123). cambridge, ma: mit press, 2003] (c) 2011 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.",0
"the experience of controlling one's own actions, and through them events in the outside world, is a pervasive feature of human mental life. two experiments investigated the relation between this sense of control and the internal processes involved in action selection and cognitive control. action selection was manipulated by subliminally priming left or right key-press actions in response to a supraliminal visual target. the action caused the display of one of several colours as an action effect. the specific colour shown depended on whether the participant's action was compatible or incompatible with the preceding subliminal prime, and not on the prime identity alone. unlike previous studies, therefore, the primes did not predict the to-be-expected action effects. participants rated how much control they experienced over the different colours. replicating previous results, compatible primes facilitated responding, whereas incompatible primes interfered with response selection. crucially, priming also modulated the sense of control over action effects: participants experienced more control over colours produced by actions that were compatible with the preceding prime than over colours associated with prime-incompatible actions. experiment 2 showed that this effect was not solely due to priming modulating action-effect contingencies. these results suggest that sense of control is linked to processes of selection between alternative actions, being strongest when selection is smooth and uncontested.

"recent research indicates that people consistently make others feel a certain way (e.g. happy or stressed). this individual difference has been termed affective presence, but little is known about its correlates or consequences. the present study investigated the following: (i) whether affective presence influences others' romantic interest in a person and (ii) what types of people have positive and negative affective presence. forty volunteers took part in a speed-dating event, during which they dated six or seven opposite-sex partners. a social relations model analysis confirmed that individuals prompted consistent positive emotional reactions in others. participants were more likely to want to see dates with greater positive affective presence again in the future, and positive affective presence explained the effects of perceived responsiveness on romantic interest. associations between positive affective presence and trait predictors, including emotion regulation, emotional expressiveness, attachment style, agreeableness and extraversion, were also observed. the findings indicate that what emotionally distinguishes one individual from another lies in part in the emotional consequences of their behaviours on others.

"most research on segregation in social networks considers small circles of strong ties, and little is known about segregation among the much larger number of weaker ties. this article proposes a novel approach to the study of these more extended networks, through the use of data on personal ties in an online social network. we illustrate this method's potential by describing and explaining the degree of ethnic and gender segregation on facebook among a representative survey of adolescents in the netherlands (n = 2,810; similar to 1.1 million facebook friends). the results show that large online networks are more strongly segregated by ethnicity than by gender. drawing on the same survey data, we find that core networks are more segregated in terms of ethnicity and gender than are extended networks. however, an exception to this pattern is personal networks of ethnic majority members, whose core networks are as segregated by ethnicity as their extended networks. further analysis suggests this exception is due to their larger population size and the ethnic segregation of their social settings. we discuss the implications of these findings for the role of structural opportunities, homophily, and balance.",1
"we use the 2003 national survey of college graduates to investigate earnings differentials between white and asian american men. we extend prior literature by disaggregating asian americans by their immigration status in relation to the u.s. educational system, and by accounting for the effects of field of study and college type. net of the latter variables and other demographic controls, native-born asian american men have 8 percent lower earnings than do measurably comparable white men. our findings show that asian american men who were schooled entirely overseas have substantial earnings disadvantages, while asian american men who obtained their highest degree in the united states but completed high school overseas have an intermediate earnings disadvantage. net of the control variables, including region of residence, only 1.5-generation asian american men appear to have reached full parity with whites. most asian american men lag at least slightly behind white men in terms of full equality in the labor market net of the measured covariates in our statistical models. no one theoretical approach seems able to explain our findings; instead, we suggest the relevance of several perspectives, including the racialized hierarchy view, the demographic heterogeneity approach, and assimilation theory.",1
"conventional social mobility research, which measures family social class background relative to only fathers' characteristics, presents an outmoded picture of families-a picture wherein mothers' economic participation is neither common nor important. this article demonstrates that such measurement is theoretically and empirically untenable. models that incorporate both mothers' and fathers' characteristics into class origin measures fit observed mobility patterns better than do conventional models, and for both men and women. furthermore, in contrast to the current consensus that conventional measurement strategies do not alter substantive research conclusions, analyses of cohort change in social mobility illustrate the distortions that conventional practice can produce in stratification research findings. by failing to measure the impact of mothers' class, the current practice misses a recent upturn in the importance of family background for class outcomes among men in the united states. the conventional approach suggests no change between cohorts, but updated analyses reveal that inequality of opportunity increased significantly for men born since the mid-1960s compared with those born earlier in the century.",1

"economic development and gender equality is there a gender kuznets curve? by joshua eastin and aseem prakash this research note examines the relationship between economic development and gender equality. drawing on the concept of the kuznets curve, the authors hypothesize that the relationship between economic development and gender inequality is curvilinear (s shaped), with three distinct stages. in the first stage, economic development improves gender equality because it enables greater female labor-force participation. an independent income stream increases women's intrahousehold bargaining power. the opportunity to develop human capital confers greater political and social recognition. in the second stage, labor-force stratification and gender discrimination encourage divergent male/female income trajectories, which decrease the opportunity costs of female labor-force withdrawal and lend traction to social resistance against burgeoning gender norms. consequently, there is a deceleration in initial equality gains. in the final stage, gender equality again improves, as greater educational participation and technological advancement provide new employment opportunities for women, increase the opportunity costs of staying home, and encourage the evolution of new social institutions and norms that overcome prior discriminatory practices. the authors find support for this argument in statistical tests of the relationship between economic development and gender equality on a panel of 146 developing countries for the period 1980-2005. they employ four indicators that reflect distinct dimensions of women's political, social, and economic status. they find economic development positively influences gender equality when per capita incomes are below $8,000-$10,000. these equality gains level off or decline slightly in the second stage, from $8,000-10,000 to about $25,000-$30,000. beyond this level, economic development is again associated with improvements in gender equality. the key implication is that the effect of economic development on gender equality is contingent on the level of development. policymakers and social activists should develop policy correctives to ensure that economic development confers improvements in gender equality across phases of development.",1
"vertical trade specialization and the formation of north-south ptas by mark s. manger during the last two decades, the number of preferential trade agreements (ems) grew almost exponentially to over 270 by 2010. a majority of these are agreements between developed and developing countries. existing models provide little economic rationale for these agreements, but the existing literature lumps north-south ems together with other types of trade pacts. this article offers an explanation focused on the movement of less capital-intensive manufacturing from north to south, which in turn stimulates the exchange of similar goods differentiated by unit value-also referred to as vertical intra-industry trade. the north exports more capital-intensive goods, while more labor-intensive goods are produced and traded by the south. this kind of specialization creates incentives for governments to support ptas. the author tests this model using a new measure of vertical trade specialization and finds strong evidence that such specialization promotes pta formation. north-south ems should therefore be seen as part of a broader shift of manufacturing from high- to middle-income countries.",1
"departing from past research on managers' responses to employee voice, we propose and examine a nonlinear linkage between promotive/prohibitive voice and managers' evaluations of voicers (i.e., manager-rated voicers' promotability and overall performance). drawing from social persuasion theory, we theorize that managers tend to give more positive evaluations to employees who engage in a moderate frequency of promotive/prohibitive voice than those who either rarely speak up or speak up very frequently. in study 1, based on a sample from a chinese bank, we found that leader-member exchange quality (lmx) moderated the inverted u-shaped linkage of prohibitive voice with manager-rated promotability of voicers, whereas the frequency of promotive voice was not related to promotability, irrespective of levels of lmx. in study 2, using employee-reported voice frequency, rather than the manager-rated measures adopted in study 1, we largely replicated the main findings of study 1 based on a sample from an information technology firm in the united states. in study 3, using another u.s. sample, from a financial services firm, we found that manager-perceived voice constructiveness mediated the curvilinear interactive effect of prohibitive voice (rather than promotive voice) and lmx on managers' evaluations of employees' overall performance.",0
"recent research on humans' prosociality has highlighted the crucial role of honesty-humility, a basic trait in the hexaco personality model. there is overwhelming evidence that honesty-humility predicts prosocial behavior across a vast variety of situations. in the present contribution, we cloud this rosy picture, examining a condition under which individuals high in honesty-humility reduce prosocial behavior. specifically, we propose that under self-uncertainty, it is particularly those individuals high in honesty-humility who reduce trust in unknown others and become less prosocial. in 5 studies, we assessed honesty-humility, manipulated self-uncertainty, and measured interpersonal trust or trust in social institutions using behavioral or questionnaire measures. in study 1, individuals high (vs. low) in honesty-humility showed higher levels of trust. this relation was mediated by their positive social expectations about the trustworthiness of others. inducing self-uncertainty decreased trust, particularly in individuals high in honesty-humility (studies 2-5). making use of measuring the mediator (studies 2 and 3) and applying a causal chain design (studies 4a and 4b), it is shown that individuals high in honesty-humility reduced trust because self-uncertainty decreased positive social expectations about others. we end with an applied perspective, showing that honesty-humility is predictive of trust in social institutions (e.g., trust in the police; study 5a), and that self-uncertainty undermined trust in the police especially for individuals high in honesty-humility (study 5b). by these means, the present research shows that individuals high in honesty-humility are not unconditionally prosocial. further implications for honesty-humility as well as for research on self-uncertainty and trust are discussed.",0
adults and preschool-aged children believe that internal properties are more important than external properties when determining an agent's identity over time. the current study examined the developmental origins of this understanding using a manual-search individuation task with 13-month-old infants. subjects observed semi-transparent objects that looked and behaved like animate agents placed into box that they could reach but not see into. across trials infants observed objects with either the same- or different-colored insides placed into the box. we found that infants used internal property differences more than external property differences to determine how many agents were involved in the event. a second experiment confirmed that this effect was specific to the domain of animate entities. these results suggest that infants are biased to see an agent's 'insides' as more important for determining its identity over time than its outside properties.,0
"theories of embodied cognition emphasize the importance of sensorimotor schemas linked to external world experience for representing conceptual knowledge. accordingly, some researchers have proposed that the spatial representation of numerical and non-numerical sequences relies on visuomotor routines, like reading habit and finger counting. there is a growing interest in how these two routines contribute to the spatial representation of ordinal sequences, although no investigation has so far directly compared them. the present study aims to investigate how these routines contribute to represent ordinal information in space. to address this issue, bilingual participants reading either from left-to-right or right-to-left were required to map ordinal information to all fingers of their right dominant hand. critically, we manipulated both the direction of the mapping and the language of the verbal information. more specifically, a finger-mapping compatibility task was adopted in three experiments to explore the spatial representation of numerical (digit numbers and number words) and non-numerical (days of the week, presented in hebrew and in english) sequences. results showed that numerical information was preferentially mapped according to participants' finger counting habits, regardless of hand posture (prone and supine), number notation and reading habit. however, for non-numerical ordinal sequences, reading and finger counting directions both contributed to determine a preferential spatial mapping. these findings indicate that abstract knowledge representation relies on multiple over-trained visuomotor routines. more generally, these results highlight the capacity of our cognitive system to flexibly represent abstract ordered information, by relying on different directional experiences (finger counting, reading direction) depending on the stimuli and on the task at hand.

"there is currently debate about the extent to which non-linguistic beings such as human infants and great apes are capable of absent reference. in a series of experiments we investigated the flexibility and specificity of great apes' (n = 36) and 12 month-old infants' (n = 40) requests for absent entities. subjects had the choice between requesting visible objects directly and using the former location of a depleted option to request more of these now-absent entities. importantly, we systematically varied the quality of the present and absent options. we found that great apes as well as human infants flexibly adjusted their requests for absent entities to these contextual variations and only requested absent entities when the visible option was of lower quality than the absent option. these results suggest that the most basic cognitive capacities for absent reference do not depend on language and are shared by humans and their closest living relatives.

"people's moods can influence moral judgment. such influences may arise because moods affect moral emotion, or because moods affect moral thought. the present study provides evidence that, at least in the footbridge dilemma, moods affect moral thought. the results of two experiments are reported in which, after induction of positive, negative, or neutral moods and presentation of the footbridge scenario, participants were asked one of two differentially. framed closing questions. in the active frame, participants were asked whether they would be active and push the man, making thoughts about pushing accessible; in the passive frame, they were asked whether they would be passive and not push the man, making thoughts about not pushing accessible. the results show that affective influences on moral judgment depended on participants' decision frame. compared to neutral moods, positive moods induced utilitarian responding - i.e., deciding to push - in the active decision frame, but induced nonutilitarian responding - i.e., deciding to not push - in the passive decision frame; in negative moods, exactly the opposite picture arose. the results suggest that people's moods affect moral judgment by conferring value on moral thought. positive moods promote and negative moods inhibit accessible thoughts.

"attention lapses resulting from reactivity to task challenges and their consequences constitute a pervasive factor affecting everyday performance errors and accidents. a bidirectional model of attention lapses (error <-> attention-lapse: cheyne, solman, carriere, & smilek, 2009) argues that errors beget errors by generating attention lapses; resource-depleting cognitions interfering with attention to subsequent task challenges. attention lapses lead to errors, and errors themselves are a potent consequence often leading to further attention lapses potentially initiating a spiral into more serious errors. we investigated this challenge-induced error <-> attention-lapse model using the sustained attention to response task (sart), a go-nogo task requiring continuous attention and response to a number series and withholding of responses to a rare nogo digit. we found response speed and increased commission errors following task challenges to be a function of temporal distance from, and prior performance on, previous nogo trials. we conclude by comparing and contrasting the present theory and findings to those based on choice paradigms and argue that the present findings have implications for the generality of conflict monitoring and control models.

"assessing children's episodic future thinking by having them select items for future use may be assessing their functional reasoning about the future rather than their future episodic thinking. in an attempt to circumvent this problem, we capitalised on the fact that episodic cognition necessarily has a spatial format (clayton & russell, 2009; hassabis & maguire, 2007). accordingly, we asked children of 3, 4, and 5 to chose items they would need to play a game (blow football) from the opposite side of the table on which they had never before played. the crucial item was the box that was needed by children to reach the table from the other side. over four experiments, we demonstrated that, while children of 3 perform poorly on future questions and children of 5 generally perform quite well, children of 4 years find a question about what they themselves will need to play in the future harder to answer than a similar question posed about another child. we suggest that this result is due to the 'growth error' of over-applying newly-developed level 2 perspective-taking skills (flavell et al., 1981), which encourages the selection of non-functional items. the data are discussed in terms of perspective-taking abilities in children and of the neural correlates of episodic cognition, navigation, and theory of mind.

"historically, it was believed the perceptual mechanisms involved in individuating faces developed only very slowly over the course of childhood, and that adult levels of expertise were not reached until well into adolescence. over the last 10 years, there has been some erosion of this view by demonstrations that all adult-like behavioural propel-ties are qualitatively present in young children and infants. determining the age of maturity, however, requires quantitative comparison across age groups, a task made difficult by the need to disentangle development in face perception from development in all the other cognitive factors that affect task performance. here, we argue that full quantitative maturity is reached early, by 5-7 years at the latest and possibly earlier. this is based on a comprehensive literature review of results in the 5-years-to-adult age range, with particular focus on the results of the few previous studies that are methodologically suitable for quantitative comparison of face effects across age, plus three new experiments testing development of holistic/configural processing (faces versus objects, disproportionate inversion effect), ability to encode novel faces (assessed via implicit memory) and face-space (own-age bias).

"does a major natural disaster change human values and job preferences? the present studies examined whether the experience of a natural disaster experience shifts people's values and job preferences toward pro-social directions. in study 1 (cross-temporal analysis), we analysed job application data in nine cities in japan over 12years and found that the popularity of pro-social occupations (e.g. firefighter) increased after the great hanshin-awaji earthquake in 1995, in particular the area hit hardest by the quake. in study 2 (a large national survey), we found that japanese respondents who had experienced a major earthquake are more likely to hold a pro-social job than those who never experienced a major earthquake. together, the current findings suggest that the experience of a major natural disaster shifts human values from the egocentric to the allocentric direction, which in turn could result in a social structure that values pro-social occupations. copyright (c) 2017 european association of personality psychology",1

"encompassing labor movements and coordinated wage setting are central to the social democratic economic model that has proven successful among the nations of western europe. the coordination of wage bargaining across many unions and employers has been used to explain everything from inequality to unemployment. yet there has been limited theoretical and quantitative empirical work exploring the determinants of bargaining coordination. i argue formally that more unequally distributed resources across unions should inhibit the centralization of strike powers in union federations. using membership as a proxy for union resources, i find empirical evidence for this hypothesis in a panel of 15 oecd democracies, 1950-2000. i then show that the centralization of strike powers is a strong predictor of coordinated bargaining.",1
"every dictator dislikes free media. yet, many nondemocratic countries have partially free or almost free media. in. this article, we develop a theory of media freedom in dictatorships and provide systematic statistical evidence in support of this theory. in our model, free media allow a dictator to provide incentives to bureaucrats and therefore to improve the quality of government. the importance of this benefit varies with the natural resource endowment. in resource-rich countries, bureaucratic incentives are less important for the dictator; hence, media freedom is less likely to emerge. using panel data, we show that controlling for country fixed effects, media are less free in oil-rich economies, with the effect especially pronounced in nondemocratic regimes. these results are robust to model specification and the inclusion of various controls, including the level of economic development, democracy, country size, size of government, and others.",1
"predicting the future is a basic problem that people have to solve every day and a component of planning, decision making, memory, and causal reasoning. in this article, we present 5 experiments testing a bayesian model of predicting the duration or extent of phenomena from their current state. this bayesian model indicates how people should combine prior knowledge with observed data. comparing this model with human judgments provides constraints on possible algorithms that people might use to predict the future. in the experiments, we examine the effects of multiple observations, the effects of prior knowledge, and the difference between independent and dependent observations, using both descriptions and direct experience of prediction problems. the results indicate that people integrate prior knowledge and observed data in a way that is consistent with our bayesian model, ruling out some simple heuristics for predicting the future. we suggest some mechanisms that might lead to more complete algorithmic-level accounts.",0
"several researchers point to the anticipation of early death, or a sense of ""futurelessness,"" as a contributing factor to youth crime. it is argued that young people who perceive a high probability of early death may have little reason to delay gratification for the promise of future benefits, as the future itself is discounted. consequently, these young people tend to pursue high-risk behaviors associated with immediate rewards, which include crime and violence. although existing studies lend support to these arguments and show a statistical relationship between anticipated early death and youth crime, this support remains tentative. moreover, several questions remain regarding the interpretation of this relationship, the meanings that offenders attach to the prospect of early death, and the cognitive processes that link anticipated early death to youth crime. in this article, we address the limitations of previous studies using a multimethods approach, which involves the analyses of national survey data and in-depth interviews with active street offenders.",1
"openness to experiencethe enjoyment of novel experiences and ideashas many connections to cognitive processes. people high in openness to experience, for example, tend to be more creative and have broader general knowledge than people low in openness to experience. in the current study, we use a network science approach to examine if the organization of semantic memory differs between high and low groups of openness to experience. a sample of 516 adults completed measures of openness to experience (from the neo five-factor inventory-3 and big five aspect scales) and a semantic verbal fluency task. next, the sample was split into half to form high (n=258) and low (n=258) openness to experience groups. semantic networks were then constructed on the basis of their verbal fluency responses. our results revealed that the high openness to experience group's network was more interconnected, flexible, and had better local organization of associations than the low openness to experience group. we also found that the high openness to experience group generated more responses on average and provided more unique responses than the low openness to experience group. taken together, our results indicate that openness to experience is related to semantic memory structure.

"this study examined how felt security in interpersonal situations with one's romantic partner mediated the effect of global (dispositional) attachment on relationship satisfaction. felt security was measured using an event-contingent recording (ecr) methodology with a sample of 93 cohabiting couples who reported their social interactions with each other during a 20-day period. global attachment was measured at the beginning of the ecr procedure. relationship satisfaction was measured at the end of the ecr procedure (t1) and approximately 7months after the ecr procedure (t2). results confirmed the established links between attachment and relationship satisfaction such that higher attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety were associated with decline in satisfaction over time. results also indicated that attachment avoidance but not attachment anxiety was negatively related to felt security, both within-partner and across-partners. as expected, lower felt security exerted a negative effect on relationship satisfaction at t1 and t2, and partly mediated the effect of attachment avoidance on relationship satisfaction at t1 and t2, both within-partner and across-partners. partners' gender emerged as a moderator of these results. findings suggest higher attachment avoidance leads to less felt security in daily social interactions, which leads to less satisfaction with the romantic relationship. copyright (c) 2015 european association of personality psychology",1
"because the authoritarian personality was introduced to explain the rise of fascism during world war ii, research focused on its ability to predict prejudice, leaving its associations with well-being largely unexplored. studies that did examine these associations yielded inconsistent results, and some authors even argued that authoritarianism buffers against the negative effects of psychological vulnerability factors (i.e. d-type personality) and negative life events on well-being, especially among people in an authoritarian environment. using a cross-sectional community sample (n?=?1010), study 1 failed to support the idea that authoritarianism relates to depressive symptoms and buffers against the negative effects of d-type personality on depressive symptoms. using a longitudinal college student sample (n?=?499), study 2 showed that authoritarianism did not moderate the effects of life events either and even predicted over-time increases in depressive symptoms. using a longitudinal high school sample (n?=?590), study 3 showed that this effect emerged regardless of degree of fit with the social environment (i.e. with family and friends). taken together, results suggest that authoritarianism constitutes a risk factor for rather than a protective factor against depressive symptoms. copyright (c) 2011 john wiley & sons, ltd.",0

"despite the existence of a substantial body of implementation guidelines and literature on employee rights, many organizations still adopt irresponsible employee practices such as child labor and appalling workplace conditions. the implementation of such irresponsible employee practices in some suppliers has badly affected the business performance and reputation of global giants like nike, adidas, and apple. the study here conceptualizes employee rights protection as a management initiative concerning an organization's efforts in managing employees responsibly. by drawing from the literature on social initiatives and supply chain management, organizations should adopt employee rights protection to improve their corporate reputation and financial performance, and that it is important for buyers to involve suppliers to implement such an initiative in order to improve the financial performance of both parties in the buyer-supplier relationship. based on data collected from 200 matched pairs of manufacturers and suppliers in the food, pharmaceutical, automotive, and clothing industries of china, all the posited hypotheses of this research receive support. the findings contribute to practice by offering empirical evidence on the strategic importance of employee rights protection and showing the critical role of suppliers in implementing this initiative. this research also provides new research insights that extend the literature on labor rights, business ethics, csr, and supply chain management.

"there is a growing consensus that status concerns drive state behavior. although recent attention has been paid to when states are most likely to act on behalf of status concerns, very little is known about which actions states are most likely to engage in when their status is threatened. this article focuses on the effect of publicly humiliating international events as sources of status threat. such events call into question a state's image in the eyes of others, thereby increasing the likelihood that the state will engage in reassertions of its status. the article presents a theory of status reassertion that outlines which states will be most likely to respond, as well as when and how they will be most likely to do so. the author argues that because high-status states have the most to lose from repeated humiliation, they will be relatively risk averse when reasserting their status. in contrast to prior work arguing that humiliation drives a need for revenge, the author demonstrates that great powers only rarely engage in direct revenge. rather, they pursue the less risky option of projecting power abroad against weaker states to convey their intentions of remaining a great power. the validity of this theory is tested using an expanded and recoded data set of territorial change from 1816 to 2000. great powers that have experienced a humiliating, involuntary territorial loss are more likely to attempt aggressive territorial gains in the future and, in particular, against third-party states.",1

"cooperation between nonrelatives is common in humans. reciprocal altruism is a plausible evolutionary mechanism for cooperation within unrelated pairs, as selection may favor individuals who selectively cooperate with those who have cooperated with them in the past. reciprocity is often observed in humans, but there is only limited evidence of reciprocal altruism in other primate species, raising questions about the origins of human reciprocity. here, we explore how reciprocity develops in a sample of american children ranging from 3 to 7.5 years of age, and also compare children's behavior to that of chimpanzees in prior studies to gain insight into the phylogeny of human reciprocity. children show a marked tendency to respond contingently to both prosocial and selfish acts, patterns that have not been seen among chimpanzees in prior studies. our results show that reciprocity increases markedly with age in this population of children, and by about 5.5 years of age children consistently match the previous behavior of their partners.

"intralocus sexual conflict (iasc) occurs when sex-specific selection favors genes that increase fitness in one sex and decrease fitness in the other sex. the current study was designed to explore whether iasc occurs in humans. in a sample of siblings, we identified and measured sexually dimorphic traits and hormones within each sex that are related to fitness and are likely coded for by antagonistic genes: waist-to-hip ratio (whr) and breast size in women, whr and bicep size (an index of muscularity) in men, and estradiol (e) and testosterone (t) in both sexes. if these traits and hormones are coded for by genes under iasc, masculine or feminine expression of traits and hormones should differentially predict brothers' and sisters' fitness. consistent with an iasc model, both men and women who were physically masculine for their sex reported higher mate value brothers relative to sisters. similarly, in normal-weight individuals, e levels positively predicted the mate value of sisters relative to brothers and t levels positively predicted the mate value of brothers relative to sisters. we found no evidence that individuals with indicators of high genetic quality (i.e., physically masculine men and physically feminine women) share high mate value with all siblings, regardless of sibling sex. results are novel and demonstrate for the first time that intralocus conflict in humans may influence the fitness of related individuals.

"interdependent situations are pervasive in human life. in these situations, it is essential to form expectations about the others' behaviour to adapt one's own behaviour to increase mutual outcomes and avoid exploitation. social value orientation, which describes the dispositional weights individuals attach to their own and to another person's outcome, predicts these expectations of cooperation in social dilemmasan interdependent situation involving a conflict of interests. yet, scientific evidence is inconclusive about the exact differences in expectations between prosocials, individualists, and competitors. the present meta-analytic results show that, relative to proselfs (individualists and competitors), prosocials expect more cooperation from others in social dilemmas, whereas individualists and competitors do not significantly differ in their expectations. the importance of these expectations in the decision process is further highlighted by the finding that they partially mediate the well-established relation between social value orientation and cooperative behaviour in social dilemmas. in fact, even proselfs are more likely to cooperate when they expect their partner to cooperate. copyright (c) 2018 european association of personality psychology",1
"the upps-p model of impulsivity is gaining popularity among personality and substance use researchers, but questions remain as to whether its five facets have incremental validity in explaining substance use over a more parsimonious model specifying only two facets: reward drive and rash impulsiveness. in three cross-sectional studies (total n = 486), we investigated whether the novel components of the upps-p model (negative urgency, premeditation, perseverance, sensation seeking, positive urgency) predicted typical and problematic alcohol and cannabis use after accounting for reward drive, rash impulsiveness and trait neuroticism (assessed with the eysenck personality questionnaire). reward drive and rash impulsiveness scores were calculated using principal components analysis of multiple scales, including upps-p premeditation and sensation seeking. results showed that rash impulsiveness was a robust predictor of typical and problematic substance use. the novel facets of the upps-p did not improve prediction of typical substance use. the urgency scales inconsistently predicted problematic use. specifically, negative urgency predicted one of three measures of negative consequences from alcohol use, and positive urgency only predicted negative consequences from cannabis use. results suggest that the three novel facets of the upps-p model add little over a two component model in explaining substance use, although may provide preliminary evidence for the utility of a revised global urgency construct in explaining problematic substance use. copyright (c) 2017 european association of personality psychology",1
"we tested the possibility that the five-factor model of personality is associated with three measures of body weight and with changes in their levels over time and that these associations are gender specific. the study was conducted at two points of time, time 1 (2664 participants) and time 2 (1492 participants), over approximately 4 years, controlling for gender, age, education, and having a chronic disease. body weight was assessed by body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and the five-factor model by saucier's mini-markers. cross-sectional regression results indicated that conscientiousness was negatively associated with the three body weight measures, whereas neuroticism and extraversion were positively associated with the three body weight measures. the longitudinal regression results indicate that extraversion was associated with an increase in two of the body weight measures. neuroticism was associated with increase in all three body weight measures and more strongly for women than for men. openness was associated with a decrease in all three body weight measures for women, but this association was not significant for men. these findings help identify personality traits that lead to risk of weight gain and point to the modifying role of gender. copyright (c) 2013 john wiley & sons, ltd.",0
"we present a core-concept model (ccm) suggesting that stimulus centrality is an important factor in category representations in implicit measures. we tested the hypothesis that idiographic stimuli (first name, birthday) are more central and therefore assess self-concept in implicit association tests (iats) more validly than generic and nonspecific stimuli (me, you). superior validity of the idiographic variant emerged across three different domains of self-concept. first, an idiographic self-esteem iat displayed higher correlations than a generic iat with self-assessments and observer-assessments of self-esteem. second, an idiographic body scheme-iat predicted subjective ratings of body image and objective body-mass index. third, an idiographic aggressiveness-iat had higher incremental validity for unprovoked aggression when interacting with explicit measures of aggressiveness. we conclude that idiographic stimuli focus participants' attention on the core features of the self, hence, tapping into self-related associations to a stronger degree than generic stimuli. copyright (c) 2011 john wiley & sons, ltd.",0
"human information processing is influenced by the affective quality of pleasant and unpleasant stimuli. a widely known example is the emotional variant of the colour-naming stroop task. although participants are not instructed to attend to valence, it nevertheless influences response times. we studied how persons differ in ignoring the irrelevant valence of stimuli and how such differences are related to personality traits. in two emotional stroop tasks using a vocal response mode, participants were instructed to name the colour of unpleasant and pleasant words presented in different physical colours. in study 2, we introduced a second task to increase the cognitive load. across both studies, extraversion and approach temperament were associated with higher interferences by pleasant words. neuroticism and avoidance temperament, however, were associated with higher interferences by unpleasant words only when cognitive load increased because of a task switch. this finding suggests that highly neurotic individuals can mitigate influences of emotional stimuli on information processing under conditions of low cognitive load. copyright (c) 2012 john wiley & sons, ltd.",0
"previous studies on reciprocity of support in parent-child relationships during adulthood have focused on the needs of the recipient and other characteristics of the relationship, whereas the role of personality characteristics is not yet well understood. in the present research, we explored how prosocial dispositions and prosocial behaviour of both parents and adult children relate to perceptions of their relationship as reciprocal with respect to support. family social relations models were applied to disentangle general relationship behaviour and perceptions from effects unique to the parent-child relationship. study 1 demonstrated that results based on 'conventional' analytic approaches differed markedly from conclusions drawn from social relations models: the former approach indicated parents to report providing more support than their children, the latter approach revealed no differences between parent and adult child regarding their unique relationship. study 2 extended the findings of study 1 by focusing on behavioural mediators of the association between prosocial dispositions and perceptions of reciprocal support. together, the findings provide insight into interdependencies among parents and children and the predictive power of individual as well as behavioural factors for understanding reciprocity of support. furthermore, they highlight how the interpretation of parent-child relationships depends on the chosen methodological focus. copyright (c) 2010 john wiley & sons, ltd.",0
"using a dyadic design, this longitudinal study with 85 couples examined whether the stress buffering effect of optimism is due to an actual higher availability of social support or to positive illusions about available social support by taking simultaneously the recipients' and the providers' perspective on social support into account. at baseline, optimism and social support from the recipients' and the providers' perspective were assessed. perceived stress was measured at 3 months follow-up. actor-partner interdependence models showed that optimism was prospectively related to lower stress. social support from the recipients', but not from the providers' perspective, partially mediated this relationship. the results suggest that optimists hold positive illusions about available support and that these illusions account at least partly for the stress buffering effect. copyright (c) 2010 john wiley & sons, ltd.",0
"the present study examined how agreeableness and self-efficacy beliefs about responding empathically to others' needs predict individuals' prosociality, across time. participants were 377 adolescents (66% males) aged 16 at time 1 and 18 at time 2 who took part at this study. measures of agreeableness, empathic self-efficacy and prosociality were collected at two time points. the findings corroborated the posited paths of relations to assigning agreeableness a major role in predicting the level of individuals' prosociality. empathic self-efficacy beliefs partially mediated the relation of agreeableness to prosociality. the posited conceptual model accounted for a significant portion of variance in prosociality and provides guidance with respect to interventions aimed at promoting prosociality copyright (c) 2009 john wiley & sons, ltd.",1
"we examined whether gender differences in the perceived ease of being misled predict the likelihood of being deceived in distributive negotiations. study 1 (n = 131) confirmed that female negotiators are perceived as more easily misled than male negotiators. this perception corresponded with perceptions of women's relatively low competence. study 2 (n = 328) manipulated negotiator gender, competence and warmth and found that being perceived as easily misled via low competence affected expectations about the negotiating process, including less deception scrutiny among easily misled negotiators and lower ethical standards among their negotiating counterparts. this pattern held true regardless of buyer and seller gender. study 3 (n = 298) examined whether patterns of deception in face-to-face negotiations were consistent with this gender stereotype. as expected, negotiators deceived women more so than men, thus leading women into more deals under false pretenses than men.

"an influential literature has demonstrated that legislative transparency can improve the performance of parliamentarians in democracies. in a democracy, the incentive for improved performance is created by voters' responses to newly available information. building on this work, donor projects have begun to export transparency interventions to authoritarian regimes under the assumption that nongovernmental organizations and the media can substitute for the incentives created by voters. such interventions, however, are at odds with an emerging literature that argues that authoritarian parliaments primarily serve the role of co-optation and limited power sharing, where complaints can be raised in a manner that does not threaten regime stability. we argue that under these conditions, transparency may have perverse effects, and we test this theory with a randomized experiment on delegate behavior in query sessions in vietnam, a single-party authoritarian regime. we find no evidence of a direct effect of the transparency treatment on delegate performance; however, further analysis reveals that delegates subjected to high treatment intensity demonstrate robust evidence of curtailed participation and damaged reelection prospects. these results make us cautious about the export of transparency without electoral sanctioning.",1
"conventional wisdom holds that autocracies are more likely than democracies to adopt interventionist and protectionist economic policies, including fixed and undervalued exchange rates. this article suggests that this view is only partially correct: nondemocracies are a heterogeneous grouping, and only some types of authoritarian regimes adopt different foreign economic policies from those of their democratic counterparts. using the example of exchange rate policy, the authors show that foreign economic policy varies across monarchic, military, and civilian dictatorships. more specifically, they hypothesize that monarchies and military regimes are more likely than democracies and civilian dictatorships to maintain fixed exchange rate regimes because the former regimes have smaller ""selectorates"" than the latter. the authors also expect that monarchies and civilian dictatorships maintain more undervalued exchange rates than democracies and military regimes because the former regimes provide their leaders with greater tenure security than the latter regimes. these hypotheses are evaluated using a time-series-cross-sectional data set of a large sample of developing countries from 1973 to 2006. the statistical results accord with these predictions. these findings indicate that the ways in which democracies engage with the global economy may be less unique than many believe.",1
"does ""soft power"" matter in international relations? specifically, when the united states seeks cooperation from countries around the world, do the views of their publics about us foreign policy affect the actual foreign policy behavior of these countries? the authors examine this question using multinational surveys covering fifty-eight countries, combined with information about their foreign policy decisions in 2003, a critical year for the us. they draw their basic conceptual framework from joseph nye, who uses various indicators of opinion about the us to assess us soft power. but the authors argue that his theory lacks the specificity needed for falsifiable testing. they refine it by focusing on foreign public opinion about us foreign policy, an underemphasized element of nye's approach. their regression analysis shows that foreign public opinion has a significant and large effect on troop commitments to the war in iraq, even after controlling for various hard power factors. it also has significant, albeit small, effects on policies toward the international criminal court and on voting decisions in the un general assembly. these results support the authors' refined theoretical argument about soft power: public opinion about us foreign policy in foreign countries does affect their policies toward the us, but this effect is conditional on the salience of an issue for mass publics.",1
"the authors study the conflict mediation problem, sometimes called ""shuttle diplomacy,"" when the mediator acts as a go-between and must gather information from the disputants. in the context of a general model of information mediation, they show that the incentive that disputants have to lie to the mediator undoes any advantage that might be gained by adding communication with a third party. in fact, the main result shows that any equilibrium outcome that is achievable through mediation is also achievable as an equilibrium outcome of a game with unmediated preplay communication. this is true even when the mediator is allowed to have arbitrary preferences or biases. the authors then test their empirical prediction on dispute management efforts between 1937 and 1985. the analysis supports the hypothesis that information mediation has no effect in environments where the mediator has no independent source of information.",1
"event timing engages a distributed neural network including cortical and subcortical structures. however, it remains unclear whether the early visual cortex contributes to event timing. here we showed that the processes of nontemporal visual features such as orientation and spatial location, which are coded by the early visual cortex, contribute to the temporal representation of a visual stimulus. participants were presented with 2 successive gabor patches (a prime and a target) with different orientations or spatial locations. the subjective duration of the target was significantly reduced when it was preceded by the prime compared with when presented alone. more important, this duration-compression effect varied systematically as a function of orientation similarity or spatial proximity between the prime and the target and was influenced by how the prime and the target were perceptually grouped. our results suggest that repetition suppression of neural activity in response to orientation may contribute to the observed duration distortion and that neurons in the early visual cortex with small receptive fields and orientation selectivity may be involved in visual temporal perception. our findings help to understand the functional role of early visual cortex in event timing in humans.",0
"to test whether the pride expression is an implicit, reliably developing signal of high social status in humans, the authors conducted a series of experiments that measured implicit and explicit cognitive associations between pride displays and high-status concepts in two culturally disparate populations-north american undergraduates and fijian villagers living in a traditional, small-scale society. in both groups, pride displays produced strong implicit associations with high status, despite fijian social norms discouraging overt displays of pride. also in both groups, implicit and explicit associations between emotion expressions and status were dissociated; despite the cross-cultural implicit association between pride displays and high status, happy displays were, cross-culturally, the more powerful status indicator at an explicit level, and among fijians, happy and pride displays were equally strongly implicitly associated with status. finally, a cultural difference emerged: fijians viewed happy displays as more deserving of high status than did north americans, both implicitly and explicitly. together, these findings suggest that the display and recognition of pride may be part of a suite of adaptations for negotiating status relationships, but that the high-status message of pride is largely communicated through implicit cognitive processes.",0
"although humans strive to be wise, they often fail to do so when reasoning over issues that have profound personal implications. here we examine whether psychological distance enhances wise reasoning, attitudes and behavior under such circumstances. two experiments demonstrate that cueing people to reason about personally meaningful issues (study i: career prospects for the unemployed during an economic recession; study 2: anticipated societal changes associated with one's chosen candidate losing the 2008 u.s. presidential election) from a distanced perspective enhances wise reasoning (dialecticism; intellectual humility), attitudes (cooperation-related attitude assimilation), and behavior (willingness to join a bipartisan group).",0
"dual-process theory hypothesizes that recognition memory depends on 2 distinguishable memory signals. recollection reflects conscious recovery of detailed information about the learning episode. familiarity reflects a memory signal that is not accompanied by a vivid conscious experience but nonetheless enables participants to distinguish recently experienced probe items from novel ones. this dual-process explanation of recognition memory has gained wide acceptance among cognitive neuroscientists and some cognitive psychologists. nonetheless, its difficulty in providing a quantitatively satisfactory description of performance has precluded a consensus not only regarding the theoretical structure of recognition memory but also about how to best measure recognition accuracy. in 2 experiments we show that neither the standard formulation of dual-process signal detection (dpsd) theory flora widely used single-process model called the unequal-variance signal-detection (uvsd) model provides a satisfactory explanation of recognition memory across different types of stimuli (words and travel scenes). in the variable-recollection dual-process (vrdp) model, recollection fails for some old probe items, as in standard formulations of dpsd, but gives rise to a continuous distribution of memory strengths when it succeeds. the vrdp can approximate both the dpsd and uvsd. in both experiments it provides a consistently superior fit across materials to the superset of the dpsd and uvsd. the vrdp offers a simple explanation of the form of conjoint item-source judgments, something neither the dpsd nor uvsd accomplishes. the success of the vrdp supports the core assumptions of dual-process theory by providing an excellent quantitative description of recognition performance across materials and response criteria.",0
"research has shown that learning a concept via standard supervised classification leads to a focus on diagnostic features, whereas learning by inferring missing features promotes the acquisition of within-category information. accordingly, we predicted that classification learning would produce a deficit in people's ability to draw novel contrasts distinctions that were not part of training compared with feature inference learning. two experiments confirmed that classification learners were at a disadvantage at making novel distinctions. eye movement data indicated that this conceptual inflexibility was due to (a) a narrower attention profile that reduces the encoding of many category features and (b) learned inattention that inhibits the reallocation of attention to newly relevant information. implications of these costs of supervised classification learning for views of conceptual structure are discussed.",0
"in numerate societies, early arithmetic development is associated with visuospatial working memory, executive functions, nonverbal intelligence, and magnitude-comparison abilities. to what extent do these associations arise from cultural practices or general cognitive prerequisites? here, we administered tests of these cognitive abilities (corsi blocks, raven's colored progressive matrices, porteus maze) to indigenous children in remote northern australia, whose culture contains few counting words or counting practices, and to nonindigenous children from an australian city. the indigenous children completed a standard nonverbal addition task; the nonindigenous children completed a comparable single-digit addition task. the correlation matrices among variables in the indigenous and nonindigenous children showed similar patterns of relationships, and parallel regression analyses showed that visuospatial working memory was the main predictor of addition performance in both groups. our findings support the hypothesis that the same cognitive capacities promote competence for learners in both numerate and nonnumerate societies.",0
"an often implicit assumption of perceptual deterrence tests is that the elicited values pertaining to arrest risk reflect stable underlying beliefs. but researchers in other disciplines have found that reported expectations are highly susceptible to exogenous factors (e.g., anchors and question ordering), indicating that such values are somewhat arbitrary responses to probabilistic questions. at the same time, reported expectations are coherent within persons, such that respondents rank order them rationally. for deterrence, then, absolute values reported on arrest risks are likely not stable but individuals still rank order specific crimes in meaningful ways. we examine the interpretability of reported arrest risk for three possibilities: 1) reported risks are stable probabilistic values; 2) reported risks are arbitrary and uninformative for deterrence research; or 3) reported risks display ""coherent arbitrariness"" with unstable values between individuals but stable rank ordering of crimes within individuals. through the use of three random experiments of college students, our results indicate that elicited risk perceptions are arbitrary in that they are influenced by the presentation of anchors and question ordering. nevertheless, the rank ordering of crimes within and across conditions is unaffected by the presentation of anchors, suggesting that reported risks are locally coherent within persons.",1
"according to crime pattern theory, offenders are likely to select crime locations within their awareness space. previous studies have shown that offenders often commit crimes within their current and former residential areas and in areas they previously targeted. however, offenders' awareness spaces obviously consist of more locations that potentially influence their crime location choices. this study examines the importance of the residential areas of offenders' family members. most offenders visit their families at least occasionally and consequently get familiar with the areas in which their families live. it is hypothesized that family members' residential areas are at increased risk of being targeted. unique data were used to reconstruct residential histories of the parents, siblings, and children of 7,910 offenders who committed 19,420 offenses. the results of discrete spatial choice models showed that residential areas of family members are indeed at increased risk of being targeted. current familial residential areas had stronger and more consistent effects than had former familial residential areas. effects were strongest for the residential areas of offenders' children compared with those of their parents and siblings. the residential areas of male and female family members affected the crime location choices of male and female offenders equally.",1
"the aim of our study was to investigate the effects of a failure experience on the exercise of self-control in goal pursuit. we hypothesized that tonic heart rate variability (tonic hrv), a possible physiological marker of inhibitory capacity, increases the exercise of self-control in the pre- and post-actional phase in goal pursuit after failure. participants received feedback for an alleged intelligence test and subsequently worked on the same test again. as indicators of exercised self-control, we assessed self-confidence in the pre-actional phase and rumination in the post-actional phase. as hypothesized, ionic hrv was positively associated with pre- and post-actional self-control, even after controlling for the effect of neuroticism. we discuss the implications of our results for the self regulatory strength model. copyright (c) 2009 john wiley & sons, ltd.",0
"key design properties of marketing artifacts that influence consumer response include perceived attractiveness (the valenced evaluative response to the artifact) and perceived strength (the artifact's ability to capture attention). the aesthetic middle principle contends that the designs most effective in generating purchase intentions are counterintuitively not the most attractive and strongest, but rather designs tempered to be moderately attractive and very strong or very attractive and moderately strong. such designs are visual representations closer to the aesthetic middle, thereby prompting more favorable consumer responses. this research empirically tests the aesthetic middle principle in two consumer field studies, using both simple (typeface) and complex (wine package) designs. ins subsequent controlled experiment, the strongest aesthetic middle effects emerge for hedonic (rather than utilitarian) products and when less product-related information is available. the effects of the aesthetic middle occur regardless of available cognitive resources or individual differences in design acumen. published by elsevier inc.",0

"telepresence is a concept originally developed in virtual reality research. telepresence is the feeling of being there. this paper describes how researchers can use telepresence to expand previous models of destination image formation, producing an initial model of virtual destination image formation (vdif). the findings of this study confirm previous fundamental models of the formation of destination image. the study also suggests that, whereas previous research shows that travel information directly influences the formation of image without a mediator, telepresence can act as a mediator in online environments. the study shows that the presence of varied web-mediated information can act as a positive influence on telepresence, and indirectly lead to a positive virtual destination image. the study was done in collaboration with tourism tasmania, and data from 328 respondents was used to validate the model of vdif. the paper presents contributions to researchers as well as practical advice for developers of destination marketing websites.

"across five studies, we investigate the use of appeals to the moral emotion of sympathy in negotiations. we find that negotiators who actively appeal to the sympathy of their counterparts achieve improved outcomes, both in terms of distributive value claiming as well as integrative value creation. we also compare the effects of sympathy appeals to appeals based on rationality and fairness, and find that sympathy appeals are generally the most effective. these results, then, suggest that negotiators with certain sources of weakness may actually benefit from revealing their weakness, if doing so elicits sympathy in their counterparts. we also explore negotiator power as a possible boundary condition to sympathy appeals. relative to low power negotiators, we find that high power negotiators' sympathy appeals are seen as more inappropriate and manipulative, and may damage the negotiators' relationship going forward.

"why do people maintain ties with individuals whom they find difficult? standard network theories imply that such alters are avoided or dropped. drawing on a survey of over 1,100 diverse respondents who described over 12,000 relationships, we examined which among those ties respondents nominated as a person whom they sometimes find demanding or difficult. those so listed composed about 15 percent of all alters in the network. after holding ego and alter traits constant, close kin, especially women relatives and aging parents, were especially likely to be named as difficult alters. non-kin described as friends were less likely, and those described as co-workers more likely, to be listed only as difficult alters. these results suggest that normative and institutional constraints may force people to retain difficult and demanding alters in their networks. we also found that providing support to alters, but not receiving support from those alters, was a major source of difficulty in these relationships. furthermore, the felt burden of providing support was not attenuated by receiving assistance, suggesting that alters involved in reciprocated exchanges were not less often labeled difficult than were those in unreciprocated ones. this study underlines the importance of constraints in personal networks.",0
"many aggregate-level studies suggest a relationship between economic inequality and sociodemographic outcomes such as family formation, health, and mortality; individual-level evidence, however, is lacking. nor is there satisfactory evidence on the mechanisms by which inequality may have an effect. we study the determinants of transitions to a nonmarital first birth as a single parent or as a cohabiting parent compared to transitions to marriage prior to a first birth among unmarried, childless young adults in the national longitudinal survey of youth, 1997 cohort, from 1997 to 2011. we include measures of county-group-level household income inequality and the availability of jobs typically held by high school graduates that pay above-poverty wages (i.e., middle-skilled jobs). we find that greater income inequality is associated with a reduced likelihood of transitioning to marriage prior to a first birth for both women and men. the association between levels of inequality and transitions to marriage can be partially accounted for by the availability of middle-skilled jobs. some models also suggest that greater income inequality is associated with a reduced likelihood of transitioning to a first birth while cohabiting.",1

"this article studies socially responsible behavior in markets. we develop a laboratory product market in which low-cost production creates a negative externality for third parties, but where alternative production with higher costs mitigates the externality. our first study, conducted in switzerland, reveals a persistent preference among many consumers and firms for avoiding negative social impact in the market, reflected both in the composition of product types and in a price premium for socially responsible products. socially responsible behavior is generally robust to varying market characteristics, such as increased seller competition and limited consumer information, and it responds to prices in a manner consistent with a model in which positive social impact is a utility-enhancing feature of a consumer product. in a second study, we investigate whether market social responsibility varies across societies by comparing market behavior in switzerland and china. while subjects in switzerland and china do not differ in their degree of social concern in nonmarket contexts, we find that low-cost production that creates negative externalities is significantly more prevalent in markets in china. across both studies, consumers in markets exhibit less social concern than subjects in a comparable individual choice context. jel codes: c92, d03, d62, m14.",1
"a large body of scholarship finds a negative relationship between natural resources and democracy. extant cross-country regressions, however, assume random effects and are run on panel datasets with relatively short time dimensions. because natural resource reliance is not an exogenous variable, this is not an effective strategy for uncovering causal relationships. numerous sources of bias may be driving the results, the most serious of which is omitted variable bias induced by unobserved country-specific and time-invariant heterogeneity. to address these problems, we develop unique historical datasets, employ time-series centric techniques, and operationalize explicitly specified counterfactuals. we test to see if there is a long-run relationship between resource reliance and regime type within countries over time, both on a country-by-country basis and across several different panels. we find that increases in resource reliance are not associated with authoritarianism. in fact, in many specifications we generate results that suggest a resource blessing.",1
"one of the defining features of modern states is their incorporation of notions of political and social community based on shared language, history, and myths. however, large numbers of citizens in modern states have come to believe their national communities are under threat from several modern forces, including immigration. using the european social survey (2002-9), this article explores the extent to which perceived threats posed by large-scale immigration undermine national political communities by reducing trust in national politicians and political institutions. the findings indicate that even after controlling for other predictors of trust in the political system, concerns about the effect of immigration on the national community have an impact on trust in politics. moreover, having a lengthy postwar history with mass immigration mediates this effect, while the potentially mobilizing effects of far-right parties on the relationship between concern about immigration and political distrust are somewhat limited.",1
"scholars from a number of disciplines have argued that the massive expansion of the welfare state in the postwar period was at least in some part a byproduct of the cold war and the associated political competition between two rival regime blocs. however, the question of whether regime competition fuelled welfare-state growth has never been subject to systematic examination. applying spatial econometrics, this article offers the first empirical test of this argument. the authors' findings support the notion that regime competition stimulated the expansion of the welfare state on both sides of the iron curtain in the postwar period.",1
"the landscape of the global economy is dotted with institutions that regulate investment and trade. in recent years, the number of bilateral investment treaties (bits) and preferential trade agreements (ptas), in particular, has grown at a torrid pace; practically every country is a member of at least one-if not many-of these institutions. for all the scholarly attention that these institutions have received, however, there is little research tying bits and ptas together. this is surprising, since both aim to increase commerce by making it more predictable. the authors seek to fill this gap in the literature. they argue that a bit between a developed and a developing country should make it more likely that this pair of states will subsequently form a pta. that said, the wrinkle in the story is that more is not better in this regard; the authors further argue that a developing country that has many bits is less likely to conclude a pta with a wealthy state. the authors test these hypotheses using annual data on pairs of developing and developed countries between 1960 and 2004 and find strong evidence in support of their argument.",1
"objectives: the primary objective was to determine whether children and their participating parents undergoing family-based behavioral treatment (fbt) for obesity show similar dietary changes following treatment, and if so, whether these shared dietary changes explain the similarity in weight change within the parent-child dyad. method: data come from a randomized controlled trial of 148 parent-child dyads who completed fbt and were followed over a 2-year maintenance phase. energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods (""red"" foods) and fruit and vegetable intake were assessed across time. results: maintenance of lower red food intake following fbt predicted weight maintenance in children and in parents (ps < .01), and dietary and weight changes were correlated within parent-child dyads (ps < .01). most interesting, the similarity in long-term weight maintenance between children and their parents was predicted by the similarity in long-term changes in red food intake between children and their parents (p < .001). conclusions: these findings point to the important role of maintaining low energy-dense, nutrient-poor food intake for long-term weight maintenance in children and parents. furthermore, these results suggest that the correlation between parent and child weight maintenance can be explained in part by similar long-term changes in energy-dense, nutrient-poor food intake.",1
"do online social media undermine authoritarianism? the conditions under which online social networks can increase public awareness of electoral fraud in non-democracies are examined in this article and it is argued that a given online social network will only increase political awareness if it is first politicized by elites. survey data from the 2011 russian parliamentary elections show that usage of twitter and facebook, which were politicized by opposition elites, significantly increased respondents' perceptions of electoral fraud, while usage of russia's domestic social networking platforms, vkontakte and odnoklassniki, which were not politicized by opposition activists, had no effect on perceptions of fraud. this study elucidates the causes of post-election protest by uncovering a mechanism through which knowledge of electoral fraud spreads.",1
"this article extends theoretical arguments regarding the impact of economic globalization on policy making to electoral turnout and considers how distinct dimensions of globalization may produce different effects. it theorizes that constraints on government policy that reduce incentives to vote are more likely to be induced by foreign ownership of capital, while compensation through increased government spending is more likely (if at all) to be the product of structural shifts in production associated with international trade. using data from twenty-three oecd countries from 1970-2007, the study finds strong support for the ownership-constraint hypothesis in which foreign ownership reduces turnout, both directly and - in strict opposition to the compensation hypothesis - indirectly by reducing government spending (and thus the importance of politics). the results suggest that increased foreign ownership, especially the most mobile capital flows, can explain up to two-thirds of the large declines in turnout over recent decades.",1
"are voting rights a class or an ethnic issue? they are both in the diverse societies of the developing world, yet the salience of ethnicity in public discourse frequently compels people to articulate identity demands that may be inconsistent with their material interests, particularly among the rich. this article examines these ideas with an augmented list experiment about illiterate voting rights in lebanon. consistent with received wisdom, direct questions yield identity-based answers in which shiites are more supportive of voting rights than are sunnis or christians. unobtrusive questions, in contrast, yield answers about material deprivation in which poor people are more supportive of illiterate voting than are rich people. the divergence between public statements and private preferences helps to reconcile theoretical predictions that people respond to material incentives with empirical findings that they pursue identity interests.",1
"the unexpected investment decisions of companies during recessions often frustrate commentators and policy makers who view the economy from the top down. companies may act against immediate market signals during recessions because of uncertainties about strategy and the future direction of the economy. a mesolevel sociological model of how firms interpret and respond to economic conditions in uncertain times improves understanding of firms'' variable responses to recessions, which cumulatively shape macroeconomic trajectories. examining firm-level employment during four recessions from 1950 to 1970, the author generates results from dynamic panel models to show that firms set their employment levels against profits and market share and in alignment with peers and political affiliations. firms manage uncertainty by imitating peers but also by endeavoring to construct their environment collectively through business associations. this article''s counterintuitive economic findings and the evidence of social and political influences reinforce the importance of careful investigation into how firms respond to recessions.",1
"in this article, it is argued that horizontal intra-industry trade is associated with reduced conflict propensity within dyads. horizontal intra-industry trade is characterized by participation in international markets for similar - in many cases, branded - commodities, resulting from economies of scale and consumer tastes for variety. conversely, inter-industry trade in accordance with the ricardian and heckscher-ohlin models, while providing valuable trade gains, in some instances provokes vulnerability to trade partners, such that its overall impact on dyadic conflict is ambiguous. support for this expectation is found in empirical tests spanning from 1963 to 2001. additionally, there is evidence that development is insufficient to preclude conflict when jointly developed dyads engage in no intra-industry trade.",1
"using the comparative manifesto project (cmp) data for twenty established parliamentary democracies, the authors have studied the relationship between number of parties in it party system and party dispersion. they found that its the number of parties in the system increases, the dispersion of parties also increases, but only lip to it point. the boundaries of a finite issue space appear to expand lip to at most five parties. in addition, once the number of parties in the party system was controlled for, they found that electoral rules have no direct effect on party dispersion. thus, their findings validate the theoretical predictions of spatial theory while at the same time highlighting surprising ways in which the policy space is constrained.",0
"there is a popular belief that the use of military equipment can improve police efforts at social control. recent protests and riots across the country, however, have piqued public concern about racial disparities in law enforcement and the acquisition and use of military equipment by police in the united states. by using data from the department of defense's 1033 program, we conduct an agency-level analysis to assess the validity of rational choice arguments and minority threat explanations of police participation in the 1033 program. our results reveal that higher violent crime rates and lower drug arrest rates increase law enforcement participation in the 1033 program. participation in the 1033 program, however, is also a function of minority threat, with the functional form of minority threat varying across models predicting 1033 participation and the value of materiel acquired by successful departments. specifically, a curvilinear relationship exists between the relative size of the black population and involvement in the 1033 program, and an exponential relationship between the relative size of the black and hispanic populations and the value of property departments receive annually from the 1033 program.",1
"an inverse relationship between employment and crime is well established, although the mechanisms that account for the correlation remain poorly understood. in the current study, we investigate the role of work quality, measured objectively (hours, income) as well as subjectively (commitment). a routine activities perspective is proposed for the work-crime relationship, and it inspires hypotheses about the way that work reduces crime indirectly, in part, through unstructured leisure and substance-using behaviors that tend to carry situational inducements to offend. the results derive from within-person analyses of monthly data provided by adult male offenders recently admitted to state prison in the second nebraska inmate study (n = 717; nt = 21,965). the findings indicate that employment significantly reduces self-report crime but only when employed men report strong commitment to their jobs, whereas other work characteristics are unrelated to crime. this indicates that, among serious criminally involved men, the subjective experience of work takes priority over its objective characteristics. the results also indicate that routine activities only partly mediate the relationship among work, job commitment, and crime, whereas the majority of the work-crime relationship remains unmediated.",1
"we aimed to shed light on the reason why individual employees adjust their absence levels to their co-workers' absence behavior and under what conditions imitation is most likely by integrating social learning theory and social exchange theory. in study 1, a vignette study among 299 employees, we found that respondents were more likely to call in sick when coworkers were often absent because respondents had more tolerant absence norms and more economic as opposed to cooperative exchange norms. this study also showed that employees strongly disapproved of absence and had stronger cooperative exchange norms when they worked in highly cohesive and task interdependent teams. in study 2, a field study in 97 teams, we found that coworker absence was less strongly imitated under conditions of high cohesiveness and task interdependency. our findings suggest that employee behavior is not only influenced by team norms about acceptable absence levels, but also by norms on what level of cooperation is expected.

"how do americans organize their political beliefs? this article argues that party polarization and the growing prominence of moral issues in recent decades have catalyzed different responses by different groups of americans. the article investigates systematic heterogeneity in the organization of political attitudes using relational class analysis, a graph-based method for detecting multiple patterns of opinion in survey data. three subpopulations, each characterized by a distinctive way of organizing its political beliefs, are identified: ideologues, whose political attitudes strongly align with either liberal or conservative categories; alternatives, who are instead morally conservative but economically liberal, or vice versa; and agnostics, who exhibit weak associations between political beliefs. individuals' sociodemographic profiles, particularly their income, education, and religiosity, lie at the core of the different ways in which they understand politics. results show that while ideologues have gone through a process of issue alignment, alternatives have grown increasingly apart from the political agendas of both parties. the conflictual presence of conservative and liberal preferences has often been resolved by alternative voters in favor of the republican party.",1
"objective: imagery-based interventions represent an inexpensive, potentially effective technique for changing health behavior and promoting adaptive health outcomes. however, research adopting mental imagery techniques in health behavior interventions has shown considerable variability in effects across studies. in the present analysis we present a quantitative synthesis of the effectiveness of mental imagery interventions in health behavior and tested effects of key moderators. method: a systematic database search for studies adopting imagery interventions in health behavior and related outcomes was conducted with additional manual searches and direct author contact for unpublished studies. data were extracted for imagery intervention effects on behavioral, psychological, and physiological outcomes. and for candidate moderators. results: twenty-six studies of mental imagery intervention effects comprising 33 independent data sets met eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review. mental imagery interventions led to nontrivial, small averaged corrected effect sizes on postintervention behavior, intention, perceived control, and attitude, and a small-to-medium sized effect on postintervention physiological measures. suhstantive heterogeneity in the effects meant that a search for moderators was warranted. moderator analyses indicated larger effects of imagery interventions on health behaviors in studies on older, nonstudent samples, when detailed instructions were provided, in studies with higher methodological quality scores, and in studies of longer duration. effect sizes for imagery on behavioral and physiological outcomes were larger than effects on psychological outcomes. conclusion: results support effects of mental imagery interventions on health behaviors, identify conditions in which they may be more effective, and point to how future imagery interventions might be optimized.",0
"objective: the results from experimental studies indicate that physically active individuals remain calmer and report less anxiety after the induction of a standardized stressor. the current study extends this research to real life, and examines whether daily physical activity attenuates negative affect that occurs in response to naturally occurring daily stressors. method: the current study used data from the second wave of the national study of daily experiences, a sub-study of the second wave of the midlife in the united states study (midus-ii) of 2,022 individuals aged 33-84 questioned nightly for eight consecutive days about their general affect and affective responses to stressful events and their engagement in physical activity. results: results indicated that while negative affect is significantly elevated on days with stressful events compared to days free of events in all individuals, these effects are attenuated in those who remain physically active when compared to those who were underactive. this was also true for any day participants were physically active. importantly, negative affect in response to any specific stressor was reduced the closer in time that the stressor occurred to the bout of exercise in underactive participants, while, in active participants, negative affect in response to any stressor remained low throughout the entire day that participants reported that they were active. conclusion: given the significant mental and physical health implications of elevated affective reactivity observed in previous studies, the current study sheds further light on the importance of remaining physically active in times of stress.",0
"in many contemporary urban spaces, political information accrues to high status neighborhoods. this might exacerbate political inequality as the information-rich and information-poor each talk primarily with others like themselves. when information is specific and broadly diffused through the media, however, the convenience and low cognitive costs of everyday conversation could be especially helpful for the disadvantaged. this article shows how political conversations intensify or ameliorate spatial knowledge gaps, using a six-wave panel survey in fifty brazilian neighborhoods between 2002 and 2006. multilevel models demonstrate that conversation was more frequent in high education neighborhoods, but had a greater impact on specific, factual knowledge in low-education neighborhoods, leading to shrinking knowledge gaps. however, conversation slightly widened spatial gaps in socially perceived general knowledge.",1
"to evaluate calls for a more theoretically generalizable, large-n study of eu interest representation, we adapt the esa model of interest system density, originally developed to study the interest communities of the american states, to the eu case. we necessarily modify both model and measures in order to account for the unique features of the eu policy process. we test the model with ols regression using data on the density of different types or guilds (economic and social sectors) of organized interests in the european union. we use the findings to discuss the viability of inter-system transfers of theories about the politics of interest representation.",0
"numerous recent studies have addressed how the investment choices of firms depend on elite perceptions of the quality of national regulatory regimes. likewise, other studies show that government structures can help to support credible commitments that protect market mechanisms. the authors provide the first analytic discussion of elite perceptions of national regulatory quality as a function of the independence of regulatory in a country's political system. their central claims are that market operations depend oil perceptions of regulatory quality and that independent regulators facilitate elite perceptions of regulatory quality because they check actors in domestic political systems. cross-national statistical evidence suggests that regulatory independence supports elite perceptions of high regulatory quality. this article also provides evidence that regulatory independence is more likely where political competition shapes incentives to intervene in business markets.",0
"although it is consistently identified as a critical component of team performance, team communication is often conceptualized in a variety of manners. the present meta-analysis addresses this inconsistency by examining the moderating influence of communication characteristics, as well as other salient team and task characteristics, on the relationship between team communication and performance. the findings revealed several fundamental insights. first, communication quality had a significantly stronger relationship with team performance than communication frequency. second, further distinguishing between different communication types, classifying communication into the eight most commonly measured communication forms (e.g., knowledge sharing, information elaboration), has further value; information elaboration has the strongest relationship with performance while self-report frequency and objective frequency have the weakest relationships. third, familiar and face-to-face teams exhibited a stronger relationship between communication and performance. these results indicate the necessity of distinguishing between different communication types in both practical and theoretical applications of team science.",1
"this study focused on whether and how deliberations affected the comprehension of capital penalty phase jury instructions and patterns of racially discriminatory death sentencing. jury-eligible subjects were randomly assigned to view one of four versions of a simulated capital penalty trial in which the race of defendant (black or white) and the race of victim (black or white) were varied orthogonally. the participants provided their initial ""straw"" sentencing verdicts individually and then deliberated in simulated 4-7 person ""juries."" results indicated that deliberation created a punitive rather than lenient shift in the jurors' death sentencing behavior, failed to improve characteristically poor instructional comprehension, did not reduce the tendency for jurors to misuse penalty phase evidence (especially, mitigation), and exacerbated the tendency among white mock jurors to sentence black defendants to death more often than white defendants.",1
"the effects of gang membership on individual social, behavior, cognitive, and health outcomes are well documented. yet, research consistently has shown that gang membership and the boundaries of gangs are often fluid and amorphous. the current study examines how social proximity to a gang member in one's co-offending network influences the probability of being a gunshot victim. we re-create and analyze the social network of all individuals who were arrested, summonsed for a quality-of-life violation, and subjected to noncustodial police contacts in newark, new jersey, during a 1-year time period (n = 10,531). a descriptive network analysis finds an extreme concentration of fatal and nonfatal gunshot injuries within a small social network: nearly one third of all shootings in newark occur in a network that contains less than 4 percent of the city's total population. furthermore, a series of logistic regression models finds that being directly or indirectly linked to a gang member in one's co-offending network has a significant effect on one's probability of being a gunshot victim. implications of these findings for the study of gangs, gun violence, and a public health approach to violence are discussed.",1
"according to the democratic domino theory, increases or decreases in democracy in one country spread and ""infect"" neighboring countries, increasing or decreasing their democracy in turn. using spatial econometrics and panel data that cover over 130 countries between 1850 and 2000, this article empirically investigates the democratic domino theory. we find that democratic dominoes do in fact fall as the theory contends. however, these dominoes fall significantly ""lighter"" than the importance of this model suggests. countries ""catch"" only about 11% of the increases or decreases in their average geographic neighbors' increases or decreases in democracy. this finding has potentially important foreign policy implications. the ""lightness"" with which democratic dominoes fall suggests that even if foreign military intervention aimed at promoting democracy in undemocratic countries succeeds in democratizing these nations, intervention is likely to have only a small effect on democracy in their broader regions.",1
"who are the people who maintain satisfying friendships? and, what are the behaviours that might explain why those people achieve high friendship satisfaction? we examined the associations between personality (self-reports and peer-reports) and friendship satisfaction (self-reports) among 434 students. we also examined whether role personality (how people act with their friends) and quantity and quality of social interactions using ecological momentary assessment mediate the associations between personality and friendship satisfaction. extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and (low) neuroticism were associated with higher levels of friendship satisfaction. these associations could not be accounted for by individual differences in role personality. in addition, our results suggest that quantity of time spent with friends and quality of friend interactions (depth of conversation, self-disclosure and lack of emotion suppression), although associated with friendship satisfaction, do not account for the associations between trait personality and friendship satisfaction. future research should examine other potential interpersonal processes that explain why some people are more satisfied with their friendships than others and the consequences of friendship satisfaction (e.g. for well-being). copyright (c) 2015 european association of personality psychology",1
"previous studies that have directly manipulated outcome desirability have often found little effect on likelihood judgments (i.e., no desirability bias or wishful thinking). the present studies tested whether selections of new information about outcomes would be impacted by outcome desirability, thereby biasing likelihood judgments. in study 1, participants made predictions about novel outcomes and then selected additional information to read from a buffet. they favored information supporting their prediction, and this fueled an increase in confidence. studies 2 and 3 directly manipulated outcome desirability through monetary means. if a target outcome (randomly preselected) was made especially desirable, then participants tended to select information that supported the outcome. if made undesirable, less supporting information was selected. selection bias was again linked to subsequent likelihood judgments. these results constitute novel evidence for the role of selective exposure in cases of overconfidence and desirability bias in likelihood judgments.

"two experimental studies demonstrated that feeling as though an object, such as an idea, is ""ours"" (i.e., experiencing feelings of psychological ownership) propels people to selectively adopt others' suggestions for change. whereas feelings of ownership caused individuals to embrace the adoption of suggestions that expanded upon their possessions (additive change), it simultaneously made them shun the adoption of suggestions that shrank them (subtractive change) (studies 1 and 2). furthermore, results indicated that both a sense of personal loss and negative affect sequentially mediated this joint effect of psychological ownership and change type on the adoption of others' suggestions for change (study 2). our findings suggest that the nature of change and how it impacts high ownership people's sense of loss and negative affect is an important determinant of whether feelings of ownership will cause individuals to remain open to or resist others' suggestions for change.

"negotiations trigger anxiety. across four studies, we demonstrate that anxiety is harmful to negotiator performance. in our experiments, we induced either anxiety or neutral feelings and studied behavior in negotiation and continuous shrinking-pie tasks. compared to negotiators experiencing neutral feelings, negotiators who feel anxious expect lower outcomes, make lower first offers, respond more quickly to offers, exit bargaining situations earlier, and ultimately obtain worse outcomes. the relationship between anxiety and negotiator behavior is moderated by negotiator self-efficacy: high self-efficacy mitigates the harmful effects of anxiety.

"although scholars and practitioners have repeatedly touted the importance of negotiating effectively across cultures, paradoxically, little research has addressed what predicts intercultural negotiation effectiveness. in this research, we examined the impact of cultural intelligence (cq) on intercultural negotiation processes and outcomes, controlling for other types of intelligence (cognitive ability and emotional intelligence), personality (openness and extraversion), and international experience. transcripts of 124 american and east asian negotiators were coded for sequences of integrative information behaviors and cooperative relationship management behaviors. cq measured a week prior to negotiations predicted the extent to which negotiators sequenced integrative information behaviors, which in turn predicted joint profit, over and beyond other individual differences. additional analyses revealed that the level of integrative sequencing was more a function of the lower-scoring than the higher-scoring negotiator within the dyad. other individual difference characteristics were not related to effective intercultural negotiation processes. theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

"this study examines the bases of residential segregation in a late nineteenth century american city, recognizing the strong tendency toward homophily within neighborhoods. our primary question is how ethnicity, social class, nativity, and family composition affect where people live. segregation is usually studied one dimension at a time, but these social differences are interrelated, and thus a multivariate approach is needed to understand their effects. we find that ethnicity is the main basis of local residential sorting, while occupational standing and, to a lesser degree, family life cycle and nativity also are significant. a second concern is the geographic scale of neighborhoods: in this study, the geographic area within which the characteristics of potential neighbors matter in locational outcomes of individuals. studies of segregation typically use a single spatial scale, often one determined by the availability of administrative data. we take advantage of a unique data set containing the address and geo-referenced location of every resident. we conclude that it is the most local scale that offers the best prediction of people's similarity to their neighbors. adding information at larger scales minimally improves prediction of the person's location. the 1880 neighborhoods of newark, new jersey, were formed as individuals located themselves among similar neighbors on a single street segment.",1
"the authors present an alternative to power resource theory as an approach to the study of distribution and redistribution. while they agree that partisanship and union power are important, they argue that both are endogenous to more fundamental differences in the organization of capitalist democracies. specifically, center-left governments result from pr consensus political systems (as opposed to majoritarian systems), while strong unions have their origins in coordinated (as opposed to liberal) capitalism. these differences in political representation and in the organization of production developed jointly in the early twentieth century and explain the cross-national pattern of distribution and redistribution. the clusters have their origins in two distinct political economic conditions in the second half of the nineteenth century: one in which locally coordinated economies were coupled with strong guild traditions and heavy investment in cospecific assets and one in which market-based economies were coupled with liberal states and more mobile assets.",1
"objective: for people living with hiv, treatment adherence self-efficacy is an important predictor of treatment adherence and, therefore, of clinical outcomes. using experience sampling method (esm), this study aimed to examine: (1) the within-person association between moment-to-moment changes in social support and hiv treatment self-efficacy; (2) the moderators of this within-person association; (3) the concordance between questionnaire and esm measurement of treatment self-efficacy; and (4) the utility of each approach (esm and questionnaire) in predicting adherence to medication, adherence to clinic visits, cd4 counts, and viral load. method: men living with hiv (n = 109) responded to the same set of esm questions 3 times a day for 7 days via a smart phone given to them for the study. they also completed cross-sectional questionnaires and their clinic data was extracted from medical records to examine predictors and consequences of state and trait treatment self-efficacy. results: in within-person hierarchical linear modeling (hlm) analyses, receipt of recent social support predicted higher current esm treatment self-efficacy. this association was stronger for individuals reporting higher avoidance coping with hiv. the correlation between esm and questionnaire measures of treatment self-efficacy was r = .37. esm measure of average treatment self-efficacy predicted medication adherence, visit adherence, cd4 counts, and viral load, while questionnaire-based self-efficacy did not predict these outcomes. conclusion: interventions aimed at improving treatment adherence may target social support processes, which may improve treatment self-efficacy and adherence.",0
objective: in this pilot study we tested the influence of manipulating anticipated regret on organ donor registration behavior. method: a simple web-based experimental trial was conducted. nonorgan donors were allocated to a simple anticipated regret manipulation versus a theory of planned behavior or a control condition. the main outcome measure was registration on the u.k. organ donor register at i-month follow-up. results: a simple anticipated regret manipulation led to a significant increase in organ donor registrations. conclusion: interventions utilizing anticipated regret may have the potential to significantly increase organ donation rates.,0
"objective: recent work has identified intimacy as a potentially important determinant of psychological adjustment in couples coping with cancer. little work has examined specific social support processes within the context of the everyday life of couples' cancer experience. specifically, we examined the links between breast cancer patient reports of receiving support from one's spouse/partner (support receipt) and spouse reports of providing support to the patient (support provision) with daily intimacy outcomes. we hypothesized that both patient and spouse would benefit from support receipt and support provision. method: forty-five women with early stage breast cancer and their spouses independently completed an internet-based electronic diary assessing support receipt, support provision, and relationship intimacy for seven consecutive evenings shortly after surgery. study outcomes consisted of daily relationship intimacy reported by each partner. results: as hypothesized, when controlling for patient report of support receipt, spouse report of support provision was uniquely associated with a significant additional increase in feelings of relationship intimacy for patients. moreover, the independent effects of support receipt and support provision were also found to be beneficial for nonpatient spouses' daily feelings of intimacy. conclusion: findings highlight the use of dyadic diary methods and corresponding modeling to uncover the unique benefits of support provision that may sometimes occur outside the awareness of the recipient. results are discussed in terms of conceptualizing the cancer experience in a shared interpersonal context, whereby patients and their spouses can both benefit from support as they adjust to cancer together.",0
"objective: to investigate whether self-control moderates the effect of media influences on tobacco and alcohol use among youth and if so how this effect occurs. design: in study 1, a regional sample of 10-year olds (n = 290) was interviewed in households; attention to tobacco/alcohol advertising was assessed. in study 2, a national sample of youth ages 10-14 years (n = 6,522) was surveyed by telephone; exposure to tobacco/alcohol use in movies was assessed. good self-control was measured in both studies. main outcome measures: willingness to use substances and affiliation with peer substance users (study 1); involvement in smoking or drinking (study 2). results: in study 1, the effect of tobacco/alcohol advertising on predisposition for substance use was lower among persons scoring higher on good self-control. in study 2, the effect of movie smoking/alcohol exposure on adolescent tobacco/alcohol use was lower, concurrently and prospectively, among persons scoring higher on good self-control. moderation occurred primarily through reducing the effect of movie exposure on positive smoking/alcohol expectancies and the effect of expectancies on adolescent use; some evidence for moderation of social processes was also noted. covariates in the analyses included demographics, sensation seeking, and iq. conclusion: good self-control reduces the effect of adverse media influences on adolescent tobacco and alcohol use. findings on the processes underlying this effect may be useful for media literacy and primary prevention programs.",0
"this article argues that human rights could be improved by motivating politicians and bureaucrats to put more effort into protecting human rights. it conceptualizes the production of human rights practices as the outcome of two principal-agent relationships that constrain politicians and bureaucrats. reliance on taxes is a non-electoral, fiscal factor that makes politicians more willing to protect human rights. increased government revenue, no matter the source, raises bureaucratic compensation and helps create a more accountable bureaucracy. thus both a higher reliance on taxes and larger state revenues lead to the better protection of human rights. each fiscal factor promotes a different type of accountability, both of which independently contribute to good human rights practices.",1
"here we propose a dual process model to reconcile two contradictory predictions about how people respond to restrictive policies imposed upon them by organizations and systems within which they operate. when participants' attention was not drawn to the restrictive nature of the policy, or when it was, but their cognitive resources were restricted, we found evidence supporting a prediction based on system justification theory: participants reacted favorably to restrictive policies, endorsing them and downplaying the importance of the restricted freedom. only when we cued participants to focus their undivided attention on the restrictive nature of the policy did we find evidence supporting a prediction based on psychological reactance: only then did participants display reactance and respond negatively to the policies.

"drawing from the social information processing approach, the authors develop a contingency framework that captures organizational identification (oi) diffusion through two key interpersonal influencers, supervisors and expert peers. in two multi-level studies in two countries, results consistently show that supervisors' and expert peers are important influencers of oi diffusion because their oi is positively related to frontline employees' oi. as the focal employee's organizational tenure increases, the lateral oi transmission from expert peers grows stronger while the downward oi transmission from supervisors grows weaker. work-group oi diversity weakens both the downward and the lateral transmission. a time-lagged analysis further validates the temporal order of these processes. oi in turn predicts frontline employees' objective performance. the authors discuss theoretical and managerial implications.

"although the interactionist perspective has been widely studied in organizational attractiveness, there is no research comparing the explanatory power of the complementary and supplementary hypotheses in predicting attraction. the authors test these perspectives in the context of the instrumental-symbolic framework. the authors also examine whether the use of narrow personality facets, such as trust (under the big five trait agreeableness), assertiveness (under extraversion), and imagination (under openness to experience) enhances the prediction of attraction. job seekers (n = 220) provided self-ratings of personality, ratings of organizational traits, and their level of attraction to a potential future employer. results supported predictions based on complementarity, suggesting that organizations adopting a recruiting strategy based on similarity in personality may not succeed in attracting their most preferred candidates. the findings also suggested that narrow facets are useful in predicting attraction, providing further evidence for the predictive benefits of narrow personality traits.

"our research is based on arguments that three different diversity sources in groups - agreeableness, openness, and ethnicity - might simultaneously possess separation properties that result in social categorization and variety properties that provide non-redundant and value-adding information resources. to help understand how these diversity sources interact with the additive and reductive features of communication technology to impact group creativity, we designed two studies involving computer mediation, nominal group technique, and face-to-face (control) communication. our findings suggest that agreeableness, openness, and ethic diversity possess both negative separation and positive variety properties. whereas the separation properties of all three diversity sources, as well as the variety properties of openness diversity, are evident in newly-formed groups, the variety properties of agreeableness and ethnic diversity are only manifest in mature groups. finally, the additive and reductive features of communication technology interact with all three diversity sources to impact creative group performance in different ways.

"when not knowing the negative outcome of past decision, people search for more information even when it confirms their negative suspicion. what drives this information search is the hope that the unpleasant state of ""not knowing"" ends when one faces the truth [shani, y., tykocinski, o. e., & zeelenberg, m.

"a prominent finding in escalating commitment and entrapment research is the ""responsibility effect"": people invest more in a losing course of action or persist with it for longer if they themselves initiated this action (responsibility) as opposed to if it was assigned to them. we argue that this effect is driven by participants' preferences. responsible participants usually prefer the chosen alternative since they have chosen it themselves. non-responsible participants, in contrast, represent a mix of persons who either favor or disfavor the chosen alternative. in two experiments, we demonstrate that responsible participants favor the chosen course of action more strongly than non-responsible participants do, that these preferences facilitate reinvestment in and persistence with the chosen course of action, and that responsibility has no effect over and above this effect of preferences. non-responsible participants preferring the chosen course of action made similar reinvestments and exhibited similar persistence as responsible participants.

"this study examines how employees' perceptions of specific features of the organizational context-organizational politics and procedural justice-are related to their evaluations of psychological contract breach and subsequent attitudes and behaviors. across three studies, we examined the appropriateness of four models for describing relationships among the focal constructs. results of these studies support (a) an environmental responsiveness model in which psychological contract breach mediates the effects of politics and justice on employee outcomes, and (b) a general fairness evaluation model where politics, justice, and psychological contract breach serve as indicators of a higher order factor that predicts employee attitudes and behavior. implications and directions for future research are presented. published by elsevier inc.",1
"this study tests a central theoretical assumption of stress process and job strain models, namely that increases in employees' control and support at work should promote well-being. to do so, we use a group-randomized field trial with longitudinal data from 867 information technology (it) workers to investigate the well-being effects of star, an organizational intervention designed to promote greater employee control over work time and greater supervisor support for workers' personal lives. we also offer a unique analysis of an unexpected field effecta company mergeramong workers surveyed earlier versus later in the study period, before or after the merger announcement. we find few star effects for the latter group, but over 12 months, star reduced burnout, perceived stress, and psychological distress, and increased job satisfaction, for the early survey group. star effects are partially mediated by increases in schedule control and declines in family-to-work conflict and burnout (an outcome and mediator) by six months. moderating effects show that star benefits women in reducing psychological distress and perceived stress, and increases non-supervisory employees' job satisfaction. this study demonstrates, with a rigorous design, that organizational-level initiatives can promote employee well-being.",0
"this article investigates youth judgments of the accuracy of truth claims tied to controversial public issues. in an experiment embedded within a nationally representative survey of youth ages 15 to 27 (n = 2,101), youth were asked to judge the accuracy of one of several simulated online posts. consistent with research on motivated reasoning, youth assessments depended on (a) the alignment of the claim with one's prior policy position and to a lesser extent on (b) whether the post included an inaccurate statement. to consider ways educators might improve judgments of accuracy, we also investigated the influence of political knowledge and exposure to media literacy education. we found that political knowledge did not improve judgments of accuracy but that media literacy education did.",1
all teachers (n = 32) at one middle school participated in a university-led intervention to improve student engagement. teachers discussed four principles of motivation and related instructional strategies. teachers enacted instructional strategies in their classrooms. we observed six randomly selected teachers and their students over 3 years. analyses of the dynamic patterns of teacher-student interaction (using an application of state space grids) revealed two distinct patterns. the upward group (n = 3) showed an increase of teacher motivational support and student engagement. the stable group (n = 3) demonstrated low levels of both teacher motivational support and student engagement. qualitative analyses of instructional differences between the two groups help explain student engagement. implications include conceptualizing student engagement as interpersonal classroom activity and measuring change as developmental and dynamic phenomena.,1
this research study examined whether and how professional development can help teachers design sequences of instruction that lead to improved science learning. the efficacy of three professional development programs and a control condition was compared in a cluster randomized trial involving 53 middle school science teachers from a single school district. the four conditions varied along two dimensions: (a) the extent to which the programs guided teachers' selection of curriculum materials and (b) whether or not teachers received explicit instruction in models of teaching associated with particular methods for designing instruction. results indicated that the two programs most effective at improving students' science learning were the ones in which teachers received explicit instruction in models of teaching.,1
"this study examined the student and high school contextual factors associated with high school students' enrollment in hispanic-serving institutions (hsis). the authors drew on a conceptual framework of college choice involving the concepts of multiple capitals and individual and organizational habitus to examine the postsecondary trajectories of high school graduates using the educational longitudinal study 2002/06. using hierarchical linear modeling, the authors analyzed two separate models. one model predicted enrollment in an hsi within the 2-year sector and one within the 4-year sector. distinct predictors of hsi versus non-hsi enrollment were found, particularly for the 4-year sector. this study suggests that in both sectors, high school contexts had a significant effect of channeling students toward hsis.",1
"virtually all states require teachers to undergo licensure testing before participation in the public school labor market. this article analyzes the information these tests provide about teacher effectiveness. the authors find that licensure tests have different predicative validity for student achievement by teacher race. they also find that student achievement is impacted by the race/ethnicity match between teachers and their students, with black students significantly benefitting from being matched with a black teacher. as a consequence of these matching effects, the uniform application of licensure standards is likely to have differential impacts on the achievement of white and minority students.",1
"it is important for researchers and practitioners to understand how early referral decisions are made in communities because the long-term consequences of an at-risk child being referred (or not) to an agency for evaluation and intervention are profound. this study explored one referral/intervention program for ethnically diverse, low-income children receiving subsidies to attend center-based child care, and examined correlates of referral recommendations made by teachers and clinicians. in 67 child-care centers, 899 children ages 3 to 4 (67% hispanic/latino, 25% african american, and 8% caucasian/other) were assessed at the beginning of the academic year on cognitive, language, and social-emotional skills, and 588 of these children scored at a level suggesting follow-up. clinicians and teachers generally agreed on the group of children recommended for further evaluation/referral and interventions. the referred group of children consisted of the children with the lowest scores on the child assessments and those whose parents and teachers showed the most disagreement on self-control.",1
"objective: to examine the development of muscularity and weight concerns among heterosexual and sexual minority males in adolescence. method: participants were 5,868 males from the growing up today study, a u.s. prospective cohort spanning ages 9-25 years. generalized estimating equations were used to test sexual orientation differences in the development of muscularity concerns, weight gain attempts, and weight and shape concern. results: desire for bigger muscles increased slightly each year across adolescence (beta = .10, 95% c.i. = .09, .11) regardless of sexual orientation, but gay and bisexual participants reported greater desire for toned muscles than completely and mostly heterosexual males (beta = .39, 95% c.i. = .21, .57). desire for toned muscles did not change with age. attempts to gain weight increased threefold across adolescence, with up to 30% reporting weight gain attempts by age 16. although underweight males (the smallest weight status class) were most likely to attempt to gain weight, most of the observed weight gain attempts were by healthy (69%) and overweight/obese (27%) males, suggesting that most attempts were medically. unnecessary and could lead to overweight. sexual minority participants were 20% less likely to report weight gain attempts than completely heterosexual participants. weight and shape concern increased with age, with gay and bisexual participants experiencing a significantly greater increase than heterosexual males. conclusions: sexual orientation modifies the development and expression of male weight and muscularity concerns. the findings have implications for early interventions for the prevention of obesity and eating disorder risk in heterosexual and sexual minority males.",0
"objective: to identify predictors of human papillomavirus (hpv) vaccination initiation by girls at high risk for hpv infection. method: participants were 2,098 girls enrolled in the ongoing pittsburgh girls study, who were between the ages of 12 and 15 years in 2008, and their primary caregivers. the study was conducted in the 2 years after the deployment of the first hpv vaccine approved by the u. s. food and drug administration. primary caregivers were asked about hpv vaccine uptake. girls were interviewed about pubertal development and sexually intimate behavior. results: approximately 60% of the girls had initiated the hpv vaccine in the past year. among the hypothesized predictors of initiation, african-american race decreased the likelihood and level of sexually intimate behavior in the previous year increased the likelihood of uptake. controlling for receipt of public assistance, african-american girls were close to 40% less likely to be vaccinated than european-american girls. conclusion: racial disparities in use of preventive interventions such as the hpv vaccine exist. lack of information about public financing of the vaccine, timing of vaccination relative to sexual activity, and perceptions of preventive value may limit uptake among those at highest risk for infection and negative sequelae from infection. further research to probe knowledge and attitudes toward hpv vaccination and the impact of the media on vaccine initiation and uptake may reveal specific targets of intervention.",1
"a follow-up of 107 male federal prison inmates previously tested with the psychological inventory of criminal thinking styles (picts) and psychopathy checklist: screening version (pcl:sv) was conducted to test the incremental validity of both measures. the picts general criminal thinking (gct) score was found to predict general recidivism and serious recidivism when age, prior charges, and the pcl:sv were controlled. the pcl:sv, on the other hand, failed to predict general and serious recidivism when age, prior charges, and the picts were controlled. these findings support the hypothesis that content-relevant self-report measures like the picts are capable of predicting crime-relevant outcomes above and beyond the contributions of basic demographic variables like age, criminal history, and such popular non-self-report rating procedures as the pcl:sv.",0
"the relationship between unstructured socializing ( peer-oriented activity without supervision) and adolescent delinquency is widely established and recognized, but less is known about why this relationship exists. the present study integrates the unstructured socializing perspective with insights from social learning theory and other theoretical perspectives on peer influence and empirically investigates four possible explanatory processes. the study applies time diary data to operationalize accurately the concept of unstructured socializing and survey data to capture mediating variables and self-reported delinquency ( a general frequency measure of various offenses, as well as specified measures for violence, theft, and vandalism). data were collected longitudinally with two waves of surveys and space-time budget interviews among 610 adolescents ( 11 to 20 years of age). a multilevel-path model was estimated to analyze within-individual changes over time. the findings indicate that three of the four proposed explanatory processes contribute to the explanation of the relationship between unstructured socializing and delinquency.",1
"expectancy and value have emerged as two major determinants of motivation. however, the exact nature of their functioning is less clear given that previous research failed to test adequately different goal processes. based on the recent nonmonotonic, discontinuous model of expectancy elaborated by vancouver, more, and yoder (2008), two studies were conducted and found that expectancy and value functions in different forms during the goal choice versus goal planning processes. specifically, the two constructs positively and jointly predicted one's goal choice, whereas they played independent and opposite roles in affecting the allocation of effort during the goal-planning process. these findings address gaps in theories of motivation, allow for more precise specifications of the roles for expectancy and value within such models, and further efforts toward integrating theories of motivation within a goal-centered, self-regulation framework.

"this exploratory study investigated linkages between parent, peer, teacher, and mentor relationships and adjustment among adolescents with disabilities. the sample included 228 high school students with disabilities (65% male, 50% white) across four states. overall findings indicate that students' social relationships were significantly associated with life satisfaction, problem behaviors, and school bonding and that teacher-student relationships contributed significant unique variance to these outcomes over and above influences of parents and peers. an analysis of specific dimensions of relationships indicated that trust and alienation in teacher-student relationships were particularly strong predictors of adjustment. mentors also contributed significantly to the life satisfaction of youth. collectively, our findings indicate that nonfamilial adults significantly contributed to the overall well-being of youth with disabilities.",1
"sixty fourth-and fifth-grade general education teachers were randomly assigned to teach collaborative strategic reading (csr; klingner, vaughn, boardman, & swanson, 2012), a set of reading comprehension strategies, or to a business-as-usual comparison group. results demonstrate that students with learning disabilities (ld) who received csr instruction in their general education classrooms-approximately 2 times each week over a 14-week period-made significantly greater gains in reading comprehension than students with ld in comparison classrooms (g =.52). teachers in csr classrooms were also more likely to provide feedback to students and to use collaborative grouping structures.",1
"the rise of cohabitation in family process among american young adults and declining rates of marriage among cohabitors are considered by some scholars as evidence for the importance of society-wide ideational shifts propelling recent changes in family. with data on two cohabiting cohorts from the nsfg 1995 and 2006-2010, the current study finds that marriage rates among cohabitors have declined steeply among those with no college degree, resulting in growing educational disparities over time. moreover, there are no differences in marital intentions by education (or race/ethnicity) among recent cohabitors. we discuss how findings of this study speak to the changes in the dynamics of social stratification system in the united states and suggest that institutional and material constraints are at least as important as ideational accounts in understanding family change and family behavior of contemporary young adults.",1
"we document the impact of the aids crisis on non-aids-related health services in 14 sub-saharan african countries. using multiple waves of demographic and health surveys (dhs) for each country, we examine antenatal care, birth deliveries, and rates of immunization for children born between 1988 and 2005. we find deterioration in nearly all these dimensions of health care over this period. the most recent dhs survey for each country collected data on hiv prevalence, which allows us to examine the association between hiv burden and health care. we find that erosion of health services is the largest in regions that have developed the highest rates of hiv. regions of countries that have light aids burdens have witnessed small or no declines in health care, using the measures noted above, while those regions shouldering the heaviest burdens have seen the largest erosion in non-hiv-related health services for pregnant women and children. using semiparametric techniques, we can date the beginning of the divergence in the use of antenatal care and in children's immunizations between high- and low-hiv regions to the mid-1990s.",1
"objective: to evaluate a possible physiological mechanism underlying links between low childhood socioeconomic status (ses) and poor adult health by (a) testing whether childhood ses is prospectively related to cardiovascular responses to laboratory stress in adulthood, and (b) by determining whether psychological resources buffer cardiovascular reactivity and promote better recovery from stress. method: participants (n = 246; 55% black; mean age = 32 years) were from a population-based sample of men in pittsburgh, pa. childhood ses was measured through the hollingshead index (parental education and occupation) across 10 waves between the ages of 6 and 16. in adulthood, cardiovascular measures, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure (sbp, dbp), heart rate (hr), and high-frequency heart rate variability (hf-hrv), were taken during and following standardized laboratory psychological stressors. participants completed measures of optimism, purpose in life, self-esteem, positive affect, and self-mastery, which were combined into a psychological resource factor. results: lower childhood ses predicted higher hr and sbp at recovery, independent of age, race, body mass index, current smoking, task demand, and current ses. psychological resources moderated the association between childhood ses and sbp. lower childhood ses predicted sbp recovery only among men with fewer psychological resources. conclusions: psychological resources may buffer the relation between low childhood ses and cardiovascular recovery from stress. this buffering may improve adult health to the extent that cardiovascular recovery contributes to the risk of low childhood ses for subsequent disease.",0
"this article proposes that foreign-imposed regime changes (fircs) make civil war onset more likely when they damage state infrastructural power, as in the context of interstate war, and when they change the target's political institutions as well as leadership. using rare events logit to analyse civil war onset from 1920 to 2004, it is found that interstate war and institutional change are virtually necessary (though not sufficient) conditions for an firc to cause a civil war. many control variables are included. the results are robust to different research design specifications; nevertheless, they cannot confirm that occupation troops make an firc more likely to spark civil war.",1
"objective: to investigate the association between protocol design and therapist satisfaction in the child steps randomized effectiveness trial (weisz et al., 2012). method: therapist report was obtained at the close of 145 cases seen by 77 therapists, each of whom was randomized to a standard evidence-based treatment (ebt), modular ebt, or usual care (uc) condition. results: analysis of satisfaction items revealed 2 correlated factors representing perceived effectiveness and perceived responsiveness of the treatments. therapist total satisfaction scores were significantly higher for cases in the modular condition than for those in the standard ebt or uc conditions. with regard to specific dimensions, the modular and uc cases were rated significantly higher than standard ebt cases on the responsiveness scale, whereas modular and standard ebt cases were rated significantly higher than uc on the effectiveness scale. finally, increases in effectiveness scores from first to second case were significantly larger for modular cases than for cases in both other study conditions, and increases from first to second case in total satisfaction scores were significantly larger for modular cases than for uc cases. conclusions: therapist satisfaction with a treatment approach has independent dimensions, which can vary as a function of the protocol design. by virtue of being perceived as more effective than uc and more responsive than standard ebts, the modular protocol design was also viewed as more overall satisfying than both, and secondary analysis suggested that these results were not due to mere first impressions of the protocols.",0
"objective: this study's primary aim was to examine whether the positive self-perceptual bias present in many youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd; hoza et al., 2004; hoza, pelham, dobbs, owens, & pillow, 2002) mediates the relation of childhood adhd status to later risky behaviors. method: using a subset of children with adhd and comparison children (n = 645) from the multimodal treatment study of children with adhd, we predicted that a positive bias in childhood would partially or fully mediate the relation between having adhd and risky driving and sexual behaviors 8 years later. results: results strongly supported this hypothesis for risky driving behavior but only provided limited support for risky sexual behavior. conclusions: taken together, findings suggest that future research should explore whether self-perceptual bias may be a useful target of intervention for children with adhd.",0
"previous research has shown that people form impressions of potential leaders from their faces and that certain facial features predict success in reaching prestigious leadership positions. however, much less is known about the accuracy or meta-accuracy of face-based leadership inferences. here we examine a simple, but important, question: can leadership domain be inferred from faces? we find that human judges can identify business, military, and sports leaders (but not political leaders) from their faces with above-chance accuracy. however, people are surprisingly bad at evaluating their own performance on this judgment task: we find no relationship between how well judges think they performed and their actual accuracy levels. in a follow-up study, we identify several basic dimensions of evaluation that correlate with face-based judgments of leadership domain, as well as those that predict actual leadership domain. we discuss the implications of our results for leadership perception and selection.

"while much is understood about the outcomes of different leadership styles, less is known about the antecedents of leadership, particularly with regards to how leaders' own psychological well-being impacts leadership behaviors. using conservation of resources theory as a framework, we investigated the relationship between leaders' depleted resources and their leadership behaviors. conceptualizing depressive symptoms, anxiety, and workplace alcohol consumption as resource depletion, we predicted that depletion would be associated with lower levels of transformational leadership, and higher levels of abusive supervision, and when taken together, would further exacerbate these effects on leadership behaviors. in a study of 172 leader-subordinate pairs, leaders' depressive symptoms, anxiety, and workplace alcohol consumption separately predicted lower transformational leadership, and higher abusive supervision. furthermore, partial support was found for an exacerbating effect on transformational leadership and abusive supervision.

"this study illuminates the association between cigarette smoking and adult mortality in the contemporary united states. recent studies have estimated smoking-attributable mortality using indirect approaches or with sample data that are not nationally representative and that lack key confounders. we use the 1990-2011 national health interview survey linked mortality files to estimate relative risks of all-cause and cause-specific mortality for current and former smokers compared with never smokers. we examine causes of death established as attributable to smoking as well as additional causes that appear to be linked to smoking but have not yet been declared by the u.s. surgeon general to be caused by smoking. mortality risk is substantially elevated among smokers for established causes and moderately elevated for additional causes. we also decompose the mortality disadvantage among smokers by cause of death and estimate the number of smoking-attributable deaths for the u.s. adult population ages 35+, net of sociodemographic and behavioral confounders. the elevated risks translate to 481,887 excess deaths per year among current and former smokers compared with never smokers, 14% to 15% of which are due to the additional causes. the additional causes of death contribute to the health burden of smoking and should be considered in future studies of smoking-attributable mortality. this study demonstrates that smoking-attributable mortality must remain a top population health priority in the united states and makes several contributions to further underscore the human costs of this tragedy that has ravaged american society for more than a century.",1
"given that the performance of public-sector organizations is tied to the efficient use of knowledge, this exploratory study examined factors that influence knowledge acquisition by work groups in knowledge-intensive public-sector organizations. based upon a review of the absorptive capacity and knowledge management literature, we defined knowledge acquisition as the change in the collective knowledge of groups over time. the amount of individual prior knowledge, and common knowledge among group members, managerial practices, and perceptions of knowledge applicability were identified as independent variables. data were collected from 179 individuals representing 28 work groups in 7 public-sector organizations. using multi-level regression, we found that homogeneity of knowledge at the group level and perceptions of knowledge applicability influenced acquisition, but that, contrary to much of the literature in this domain, prior-related knowledge did not have such an influence. middle-management practices moderated the impact of knowledge applicability, suggesting that middle managers provide contextual information that permits group members to better understand the relevance of external knowledge. implications for practice include the importance of training staff in teams to build homogeneity of knowledge, and ensuring that middle managers understand the organization's strategy and their roles in the knowledge-utilization process. implications for theory include the notion that prior knowledge can either encourage or obstruct knowledge acquisition.",1
"objective: in the present meta-analysis, we test the technical and relational hypotheses of motivational interviewing (mi) efficacy. we also propose an a priori conditional process model where heterogeneity of technical path effect sizes should be explained by interpersonal/relational (i.e., empathy, mi spirit) and intrapersonal (i.e., client treatment seeking status) moderators. method: a systematic review identified k = 58 reports, describing 36 primary studies and 40 effect sizes (n = 3,025 participants). statistical methods calculated the inverse variance-weighted pooled correlation coefficient for the therapist to client and the client to outcome paths across multiple target behaviors (i.e., alcohol use, other drug use, other behavior change). results: therapist mi-consistent skills were correlated with more client change talk (r = .55, p = .001) as well as more sustain talk (r = .40, p = .001). mi-inconsistent skills were correlated with more sustain talk (r = .16, p = .001), but not change talk. when these indicators were combined into proportions, as recommended in the motivational interviewing skill code, the overall technical hypothesis was supported. specifically, proportion mi consistency was related to higher proportion change talk (r = .11, p = .004) and higher proportion change talk was related to reductions in risk behavior at follow up (r = -.16, p = .001). when tested as two independent effects, client change talk was not significant, but sustain talk was positively associated with worse outcome (r = .19, p = .001). finally, the relational hypothesis was not supported, but heterogeneity in technical hypothesis path effect sizes was partially explained by inter-and intrapersonal moderators. conclusions: this meta-analysis provides additional support for the technical hypothesis of mi efficacy; future research on the relational hypothesis should occur in the field rather than in the context of clinical trials.",1
"objective: a strong relation between negative affect and craving has been demonstrated in laboratory and clinical studies, with depressive symptomatology showing particularly strong links to craving and substance abuse relapse. mindfulness-based relapse prevention (mbrp), shown to be efficacious for reduction of substance use, uses mindfulness-based practices to teach alternative responses to emotional discomfort and lessen the conditioned response of craving in the presence of depressive symptoms. the goal in the current study was to examine the relation between measures of depressive symptoms, craving, and substance use following mbrp. method: individuals with substance use disorders (n = 168; mean age 40.45 years, sd = 10.28; 36.3% female; 46.4% non-white) were recruited after intensive stabilization, then randomly assigned to either 8 weekly sessions of mbrp or a treatment-as-usual control group. approximately 73% of the sample was retained at the final 4-month follow-up assessment. results: results confirmed a moderated-mediation effect, whereby craving mediated the relation between depressive symptoms (beck depression inventory) and substance use (timeline follow-back) among the treatment-as-usual group but not among mbrp participants. mbrp attenuated the relation between postintervention depressive symptoms and craving (penn alcohol craving scale) 2 months following the intervention (f(2) =.21). this moderation effect predicted substance use 4 months following the intervention (f(2) =.18). conclusion: mbrp appears to influence cognitive and behavioral responses to depressive symptoms, partially explaining reductions in postintervention substance use among the mbrp group. although results are preliminary, the current study provides evidence for the value of incorporating mindfulness practice into substance abuse treatment and identifies a potential mechanism of change following mbrp.",0
"client speech in favor of change within motivational interviewing sessions has been linked to treatment outcomes, but a causal chain has not yet been demonstrated. using a sequential behavioral coding system for client speech, the authors found that, at both the session and utterance levels, specific therapist behaviors predict client change talk. further, a direct link from change talk to drinking outcomes was observed, and support was found for a mediational role for change talk between therapist behavior and client drinking outcomes. these data provide preliminary support for the proposed causal chain indicating that client speech within treatment sessions can be influenced by therapists, who can employ this influence to improve outcomes. selective eliciting and reinforcement of change talk is proposed as a specific active ingredient of motivational interviewing.",0
"while earlier work primarily examines the point-in-time effects of immigration on the earnings of native workers, this article focuses more broadly on the effects of immigration on native workers'' career trajectories. cross-classified multilevel growth-curve models are applied to 1979 national longitudinal survey of youth and u.s. census bureau data to demonstrate how people adjust to changing local labor market conditions throughout their careers. the key findings indicate that substitution and complementary effects depend on the stage of the worker''s career. at entry into the labor market, high levels of immigration have a positive effect on the career paths of young native-born adults. however, negative contemporaneous effects to natives'' earnings tend to offset positive point-of-entry effects, a finding that suggests job competition among natives is greater in areas of high immigrant population concentration. these results raise questions about whether foreign-born workers need to be in direct competition with natives for there to be substitution effects.",1
"in the years since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, some 400 local governments passed ""bill of rights"" resolutions in opposition to the usa patriot act. event history analyses show that cities with progressive profiles were markedly quicker to pass such resolutions. these effects are strongest in the early phase of the bill of rights campaign, a period for which there is also robust evidence of contagious influence among nearby cities. the authors argue that the campaign's success lies in the miscibility of multiple movements-the ability of groups with different beliefs, agendas, and traditions to combine around a common goal. the case is used to distinguish between strong and weak forms of miscibility and to develop insight into strategic, organizational, and political conditions that promote the construction of movement-spanning coalitions.",0
"this study examines the characteristics and determinants of english learners' (els') access to academic content in middle school (grades 6-8). following 10 years of data from a large urban school district in california, i identify two predominant characteristics of el access to content: leveled tracking in which els are overrepresented in lower level classes and underrepresented in upper level classes and exclusionary tracking in which els are excluded from core academic content area classes, particularly english language arts. using regression analysis and two regression discontinuity designs, i find evidence that els' access to content is limited by a constellation of factors, including prior academic achievement, institutional constraints, english proficiency level, and direct effects of el classification. this study contributes to understanding of the experiences and opportunities of students learning english as well as theory regarding educational tracking.",1
"massive open online courses (moocs) have been heralded as an education revolution, but they suffer from low retention, calling into question their viability as a means of promoting education for all. in addition, numerous gaps remain in the research literature, particularly concerning predictors of retention and achievement. in this study, we used survival analysis to examine the degree to which student characteristics, relevance, prior experience with moocs, self-reported commitment, and learners' implicit theory of intelligence predicted retention and achievement. we found that learners' expected investment, including level of commitment, expected number of hours devoted to the mooc, and intention to obtain a certificate, related to retention likelihood. prior level of schooling and expected hours devoted to the mooc predicted achievement.",1
"tree thinking involves using cladograms, hierarchical diagrams depicting the evolutionary history of a set of taxa, to reason about evolutionary relationships and support inferences. tree thinking is indispensable in modern science. college students' tree-thinking skills were investigated using tree (much more common in professional biology) and ladder (somewhat more common in textbooks) cladogram formats. students' responses to questions assessing five tree-thinking skills provided evidence for several perceptual and conceptual factors that impact reasoning (e.g., the gestalt principles of good continuation and spatial proximity, prior knowledge). instructional implications of the results include using the tree format for initial instruction and clarifying that most recent common ancestry determines evolutionary relatedness. broader implications for designing scientific diagrams and promoting diagrammatic literacy are considered.",1
"in a 9-month training experiment, 64 first graders with a risk factor were randomly assigned to computer-assisted structured discovery of the add-1 rule (e. g., the sum of 7 + 1 is the number after ""seven"" when we count), unstructured discovery learning of this regularity, or an active-control group. planned contrasts revealed that the add-1 conditions were more effective than regular instruction/practice in promoting the learning of the add-1 rule. contrary to the conclusions of alfieri, brooks, aldrich, and tenenbaum (2011) and kirschner, sweller, and clark (2006), participants in the structured add-1 condition did not outperform those in the unstructured add-1 group on practiced and unpracticed n + 1 and 1 + n items at the posttests. the control participants did not exhibit evidence of learning a general near-doubles reasoning strategy (if 4 + 4 is 8 and 4 + 5 = 4 + 4 + 1, then the sum of 4 + 5 must be 9). the add-1, but not the active-control, participants achieved success, including transfer, because the former had mastered the developmental prerequisites for add-1 rule and the latter had not mastered the prerequisites for the near-doubles strategy.",1
"previous research on upper echelon (i.e., top-level) executives has focused on how character flaws or lapses in ethical judgment lead to detrimental outcomes. research is lacking that specifically examines whether character strengths that are reflected in the behaviors of top-level executives are related to positive outcomes. therefore, this study examined behavioral manifestations of the character strengths of integrity, bravery, perspective, and social intelligence as influences on executive performance in the context of top-level executive leadership of for-profit and not-for profit organizations. using matched-report data from 191 top-level, u.s. executives' direct reports and bosses and board members, this study found positive relationships between direct reports' ratings of executive integrity, bravery, and social intelligence and bosses' and board members' ratings of executive performance. these character strengths each accounted for variance in executive performance above and beyond direct reports' ratings of executives' developing and empowering behaviors and other control variables. among the character strengths examined, integrity was found to have the most contribution in explaining variance in executive performance via relative weight analysis. the theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

"while existing literature on leadership articulates the importance of leader emotion, there has been little attention to the potential roles of more specific emotions. emotions such as anger and sadness have been linked to leaders in times of crisis. the current paper examined the effect of leader emotion on evaluations of leadership in the context of a failed product. in particular, we examined how the expression of anger and sadness influences the evaluation of leaders. results revealed that a leader expressing sadness was evaluated more favorably than a leader expressing anger. we found that participants' emotion mediated the relationship between leaders' emotion and the evaluation of leaders. furthermore, accepting responsibility for the crisis led to more favorable evaluations than not accepting responsibility.

"this experimental study examined transformational leadership in the context of traditional teams using face-to-face communication and virtual teams using computer-mediated communication. thirty-nine leaders led both face-to-face and virtual teams. repeated-measures analyses revealed similar mean levels of transformational leadership in both team types; however, leader rank order varied across team type. post hoc analyses revealed that the most effective leaders where those who increased their transformational leadership in virtual teams. furthermore, analyses at the team level revealed that the effect of transformational leadership on team performance was stronger in virtual than in face-to-face teams. team-member ratings of transformational leadership were equally linked to project satisfaction in face-to-face and virtual teams. considered as a whole, our results suggest that transformational leadership has a stronger effect in teams that use only computer-mediated communication, and that leaders who increase their transformational leadership behaviors in such teams achieve higher levels of team performance.

"research on segregation of immigrant groups is increasingly turning its attention from residential areas toward other important places, such as the workplace, where immigrants can meet and interact with members of the native population. this article examines workplace segregation of immigrants. we use longitudinal, georeferenced swedish population register data, which enables us to observe all immigrants in sweden for the period 1990-2005 on an annual basis. we compare estimates from ordinary least squares with fixed-effects regressions to quantify the extent of immigrants' self-selection into specific workplaces, neighborhoods, and partnerships, which may bias more naive ordinary least squares results. in line with previous research, we find lower levels of workplace segregation than residential segregation. the main finding is that low levels of residential segregation reduce workplace segregation, even after we take into account intermarriage with natives as well as unobserved characteristics of immigrants' such as willingness and ability to integrate into the host society. being intermarried with a native reduces workplace segregation for immigrant men but not for immigrant women.",1
"objective: evaluate an internet-facilitated cognitive-behavioral treatment intervention for depression, tailored to economically disadvantaged mothers of young children. method: economically disadvantaged mothers (n = 266) of preschool aged children, who reported elevated levels of depressive symptoms, were randomized to either the 8-session, internet-facilitated intervention (mom-net) or to motivational interviewing and referral to services (mirs). outcomes were measured using the patient health questionnaire 9 (phq-9; spitzer et al., 1999), the structured clinical interview for diagnostic and statistical manual for mental disorders-fourth edition-text revised (dsm-iv-tr) axis i disorders (scid; first, spitzer, gibbon, & williams, 2002), and the hamilton depression rating scale (hdrs; hamilton, 1960). results: relative to participants in the mirs condition, participants in mom-net demonstrated significantly greater reduction in depression as indexed by self-report questionnaire (primary outcome), interviewer-rated symptoms, and diagnostic outcomes. conclusions: results suggest that the mom-net intervention is effective as a remotely delivered intervention for economically disadvantaged mothers.",0
"objective: to determine the extent to which prospectively identified responders to cognitive therapy (ct) for recurrent major depressive disorder (mdd) hypothesized to be lower risk show significantly less relapse or recurrence than treated higher risk counterparts across 32 months. method: outpatients (n = 523), aged 18-70, with recurrent mdd received 12-14 weeks of ct. the last 7 consecutive scores from the hamilton rating scale for depression (hrsd-17) were used to stratify or define responders (n = 290) into lower (7 hrsd-17 scores of less than or equal to 6; n = 49; 17%) and higher risk (n = 241; 83%). the lower risk patients entered the 32-month follow-up. higher risk patients were randomized to 8 months of continuation-phase ct or clinical management plus double-blind fluoxetine or pill placebo, with a 24-month follow-up. results: lower risk patients were significantly less likely to relapse over the first 8 months compared to higher risk patients (kaplan-meier [km] estimates; i.e., 4.9% = lower risk; 22.1% = higher risk; log-rank chi(2) = 6.83, p = .009). this increased risk was attenuated, but not completely neutralized, by active continuation-phase therapy. over the subsequent 24 months, the lower and higher risk groups did not differ in relapse or recurrence risk. conclusions: rapid and sustained acute-phase ct remission identifies responders who do not require continuation-phase treatment to prevent relapse (i.e., return of an index episode). to prevent recurrence (i.e., new episodes), however, strategic allocation and more frequent ""dosing"" of ct and/or targeted maintenance-phase treatments may be required. longitudinal follow-up is recommended.",0

"objective: a group dissonance-based eating disorder prevention program, in which young women critique the thin ideal, reduces eating disorder risk factors and symptoms, but it can be difficult to identify school clinicians with the time and expertise to deliver the intervention. thus, we developed a prototype internet version of this program and evaluated it in a preliminary trial. method: female college students with body dissatisfaction (n = 107; m age = 21.6 years, sd = 6.6) were randomized to the internet intervention, group intervention, educational video condition, or educational brochure condition. results: internet and group participants showed greater pre-post reductions in eating disorder risk factors and symptoms than video controls (m ds = 0.47 and 0.54, respectively) and brochure controls (m ds = 0.75 and 0.72, respectively), with many effects reaching significance. effects did not differ significantly for internet versus group participants (m ds = -0.13) or for video versus brochure controls (m d = 0.25). effect sizes for the internet intervention were similar to those previously observed for group versions of this intervention. conclusions: results suggest that this prototype internet intervention is as efficacious as the group intervention, implying that there would be merit in completing this intervention and evaluating it in a fully powered trial.",1
"objective: therapeutic alliance has been associated with better treatment engagement, better adherence, and less dropout across various treatments and disorders. in treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd), it may be particularly important to establish a strong early alliance to facilitate treatment adherence. however, factors such as childhood sexual abuse (csa) history and poor social support may impede the development of early alliance in those receiving ptsd treatment. we sought to examine treatment adherence, csa history, and social support as factors associated with early alliance in individuals with chronic ptsd who were receiving either prolonged exposure therapy (pe) or sertraline. method: at pretreatment, participants (76.6% female; 64.9% caucasian; mean age = 37.1 years, sd = 11.3) completed measures of trauma history, general support (inventory of socially supportive behaviors), and trauma-related social support (social reactions questionnaire). over the course of 10 weeks of pe or sertraline, they completed early therapeutic alliance (working alliance inventory) and treatment adherence measures. results: early alliance was associated with pe adherence (r = .32, p < .05) and overall treatment completion (r = .19, p < .05). only trauma-related social support predicted the strength of early alliance beyond the effects of treatment condition (beta = .23, p < .05); csa history was not predictive of a lower early alliance. conclusions: given the associations with adherence, clinicians may find it useful to routinely assess alliance early in treatment. positive trauma support, not csa history, may be particularly important in the development of a strong early therapeutic alliance.",1
"this article disaggregates coalitions of third-party mediators and examines their effectiveness in interventions. first, it is argued that there is an inverted u-shaped relationship between the size of a mediating coalition and mediation effectiveness. secondly, mediators sharing a history of conflict and distrust will transfer their past relationships to a mediation attempt, making it less effective. consequently, states sharing friendly and co-operative ties with each other are more successful in managing conflicts. finally, a coalition of mediators that is largely democratic should be more effective due to a shared culture of peaceful conflict resolution, inclusivity and increased communication flows. the empirical analysis using data from the issues correlates of war project for 1965-2000 largely provides support for the theory.",0
"scholars often find that highlands and rural areas foster insurgencies. however, others have argued that cities can also be centers of insurgent activity and that nonterritorial insurgencies are different from territorial guerilla wars. we expect that in a nonterritorial insurgency, the high quality of local knowledge makes populated rural areas inhospitable to nonterritorial insurgent activity. using data from a random sample of about 750 medaille de la resistance francaise recipients, we find that departments with more residents in cities and large towns had more medal recipients than rural departments. analyses of repression patterns (finding that insurgent arrests are less likely in cities than rural areas) and the historical record provide further evidence for the information mechanism.",1
"how does contact with nonnatives affect immigration-related fears? while there is strong general support for the argument that intergroup contact decreases intergroup prejudice and fear, previous research arrives at mixed conclusions when applying this argument to the study of natives' attitudes toward immigrants. we propose that people's preexisting partisan affinities condition the effect of contact, which may explain the mixed findings. building on the literature on motivated reasoning, we argue that contact reduces immigration-related threats among leftist voters, but have a threat-increasing or no effect among rightist voters. we find support for our argument using original surveys conducted in two very different contexts: the united states and germany.",0
"much of the recent scholarship about ethnicity in comparative politics has focused on why ethnicity becomes a salient cleavage. yet opinions still diverge as to how ethnicity matters. this article tests three hypotheses relevant to this question. building on recent arguments, it first hypothesizes that voters take the ethnicity of parties and candidates into consideration. second, it hypothesizes that wherever ethnicity is politically salient, it matters beyond coethnicitythat is, voters' decisions are guided by ethnicity even when they are choosing among non-coethnics. third, it argues that the advantage conferred by ethnicity is mediated by non-ethnic factors. a large vignette experiment carried in 2013 in the indian state of uttar pradesh provides strong support for each of these hypotheses. these results imply that the influence of ethnicity on voting behavior may be subtler and more complex than what the main theories of ethnic politics usually assume.",1
"the goal of the current research was to examine how discrete positive intergroup emotional phenomena affect conflict-related attitudes in different contexts of intractable conflict. we hypothesized that empathy, but not hope would be negatively associated with aggressive attitudes during escalation, while hope, but not empathy would be associated with conciliatory attitudes during de-escalation. in study 1, we examined our hypotheses within a correlational design in an emotion-inducing context, while in study 2 a two-wave survey was conducted during real-life events within the context of the israeli-palestinian conflict; a peace summit as well as a war. both studies supported our hypotheses, thus indicating the unique, yet complimentary, contribution of each of the two emotional phenomena to the advancement of peace.",0
"this contribution investigates the role of education in domestic terrorism for 133 countries between 1984 and 2007. the findings point to a nontrivial effect of education on terrorism. lower education tends to promote terrorism in a cluster of countries where socioeconomic, political, and demographic conditions are unfavorable, while higher education reduces terrorism in a cluster of countries where conditions are more favorable. this suggests that country-specific circumstances moderate the effect of education on terrorism. the results of this study imply that promoting education needs to be accompanied by sound structural change to positively affect (individual and society-wide) development and consequently reduce terrorism.",1
"norwegian registry data are used to investigate the location decisions of a full population cohort of young adults as they complete their education, establish separate households, and form their own families. we find that the labor market opportunities and family ties of both partners affect these location choices. surprisingly, married men live significantly closer to their own parents than do married women, even if they have children, and this difference cannot be explained by differences in observed characteristics. the principal source of excess female distance from parents in this population is the relatively low mobility of men without a college degree, particularly in rural areas. despite evidence that intergenerational resource flows, such as childcare and eldercare, are particularly important between women and their parents, the family connections of husbands appear to dominate the location decisions of less-educated married couples.",1
"a long history of research has indicated that neighborhood poverty increases youth's risk taking and delinquency. this literature predominantly has treated neighborhoods as independent of their surroundings despite rapidly growing ecological evidence on the geographic clustering of crime that suggests otherwise. this study proposes that to understand neighborhood effects, investigating youth's wider surroundings holds theoretical and empirical value. by revisiting longitudinal data on more than 1500 low-income youth who participated in the moving to opportunity (mto) randomized intervention, this article explores the importance of extended neighborhoods (neighborhoods and surroundings) and different concentrated disadvantage configurations in shaping gender differences in risk taking and delinquency. the results from two-stage, least-squares analyses suggest that the extended neighborhoods matter and they matter differently by gender. among girls, extended neighborhoods without concentrated disadvantage were associated with lower risk-taking prevalence than extended neighborhoods with concentrated disadvantage. in contrast, among boys, localized concentration of disadvantage was associated with the highest prevalence of risk taking and delinquency. interactions between the immediate and surrounding neighborhoods were similarly associated with differential opportunity and social disorganization mediators. among the more critical potential mediators of the link between localized disadvantage and boys' risk taking were delinquent network ties, strain, and perceived absence of legitimate opportunities for success.",1
"inside and outside of workplaces, individuals' performance on a metric (e.g., sales) is often decoupled from past performance (rather than being tracked as a continuation of past performance). how do people respond to such performance resets, a type of fresh start on performance records, particularly when resets are not anticipated? three laboratory experiments and one field study analyzing 40 years of data from professional baseball players demonstrate their impact. specifically, unanticipated resets increase self-efficacy and thus boost motivation and future performance when they follow weak performance. however, such resets decrease self-efficacy and thus harm motivation and future performance when they follow strong performance. by identifying the conditions that determine whether performance resets improve or harm motivation, and highlighting the role of self-efficacy, this paper provides novel insights into how different ways of tracking performance influence motivation, as well as how fresh starts change behavior.",1
"this paper explores how regulatory focus affects transitions between tasks following interruptions. consistent with the research on attention residue (leroy, 2009), we argue that in order to be cognitively available and perform well on an interrupting task, people must cognitively disengage from the task that is interrupted that is they must fully switch their attention to the interrupting demand. integrating the research on regulatory focus (higgins, 1997) and attention residue (leroy, 2009), we predict that both the framing of the initial/interrupted task and the framing of the interrupting task interact to affect how well people switch their attention to and perform on an interrupting task. this investigation allows the identification of when attention residue is most likely to occur, hindering performance on the interrupting task and how attention residue can be prevented or mitigated. data across three studies support our predictions.

"objective: little research has tested hiv/sexually transmitted infection (sti) risk-reduction interventions' effects on early adolescents as they age into middle and late adolescence. this study tested whether intervention-induced reductions in unprotected intercourse during a 12-month period endured over a 54-month period and whether the intervention reduced the prevalence of stis, which increase risk for hiv. method: grade 6 learners (mean age = 12.4 years) participated in a 12-month trial in eastern cape province, south africa, in which 9 matched pairs of schools were randomly selected and within pairs randomized to a theory-based hiv/sti risk-reduction intervention or an attention-control intervention. they completed 42- and 54-month postintervention measures of unprotected intercourse (the primary outcome), other sexual behaviors, theoretical constructs, and, at 42- and 54-month follow-up only, biologically confirmed curable stis (chlamydial infection, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis) and herpes simplex virus 2. results: the hiv/sti risk-reduction intervention reduced unprotected intercourse averaged over the entire follow-up period (or = 0.42, 95% ci [0.22, 0.84]), an effect not significantly reduced at 42- and 54-month follow-up compared with 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. the intervention caused positive changes on theoretical constructs averaged over the 5 follow-ups, although most effects weakened at long-term follow-up. although the intervention's main effect on stis was nonsignificant, an intervention condition x time interaction revealed that it significantly reduced curable stis at 42-month follow-up in adolescents who reported sexual experience. conclusion: these results suggest that theory-based behavioral interventions with early adolescents can have long-lived effects in the context of a generalized severe hiv epidemic.",0
"do certain types of administrative processes better inhibit race and gender prejudices that may surface in the public workplace? we compare the effects of three distinct administrative settings on race, gender, and other biases in the workload assignments of state supreme court justices—important public policy making settings that have been understudied in public administration. in particular, we model the extent to which majority opinion–writing assignment processes exhibit prejudice in states that use randomized assignments, rotated assignments, or fully discretionary assignments, respectively. our findings confirm that administrative process matters. we use theories of status characteristics and administrative oversight to explain the relationship between administrative context and workload assignment patterns. based on data from all 50 states, we discover that prejudice exists but that certain administrative processes serve better than others to suppress race and gender biases.",1
"

this paper investigates the impact of communication in a public good game with a central authority. the central authority includes a fixed cost that increases with the level of monitoring which in turn determines the level of deterrence. the level of monitoring is both exogenously and endogenously determined. across three treatments subjects either have no opportunity to communicate, communicate only when the level of monitoring is exogenously imposed, or communicate only when the level of monitoring is endogenously selected. results suggest that, in both treatments, average earnings are significantly higher with the opportunity to communicate. most significantly, with the opportunity to communicate prior to endogenous selection, groups practically eliminate monitoring (imposing a low cost, non-deterrent, central authority), while maintaining a high level of contributions. communication appears to make groups less dependent on institutional deterrence and allows them to reduce the costs of central authority.",0

this study evaluates the turnout effects of direct mail sent in advance of the 2014 new hampshire senate election. registered republican women were sent up to 10 mailings from a conservative advocacy group that encouraged participation in the upcoming election. we find that mail raises turnout, but no gains are achieved beyond five mailers. this finding is shown to be consistent with other experiments that have sent large quantities of mail. we interpret these results in light of marketing research on repetitive messaging.",0
"foreign direct investment (fdi) into developing countries such as india and china is often met with domestic backlash by the citizens of the host country, and backlash in the form of protests and other disruptive behavior has increased the salience of public opinion in fdi policy. as one of the first survey experiments assessing chinese citizens’ attitudes toward fdi, this paper adopts a novel conjoint design to evaluate the impact, in the present project, of individual respondent characteristics and specific fdi features on respondents’ preferences. importantly, we find that low-skilled respondents are not necessarily more likely to support labor-intensive fdi, a result that challenges the conventional wisdom that individuals in developing countries abundantly endowed with labor should be more likely to support low-skilled fdi. instead, citizens are more concerned about fdi projects’ country of origin and impact on the local job market when forming their preferences.",1
we examine the role of status quo bias in the ballot wording of social issues that affect the rights of minority groups. we test the salience of this framing bias by conducting an experiment that randomly assigns different ballot wordings for five policies across survey respondents. we find that status quo bias changes the percent of individuals who vote for the ballot measure by 5–8 percentage points with the least informed individuals being the most affected by status quo bias.,1
"this paper employs survey experiments to examine how contextualizing the claims made in negative political advertising affects perceptions of their fairness. this has implications for the components of fairness judgments, e.g., if “truth” is a component of fairness, being informed that a claim is untrue should undermine perceptions of its fairness, as well as for the efficacy of “fact-checking.” our experiments on a random national telephone sample show some effects of being informed that a claim is untrue but few if it is characterized as taken out of context or as irrelevant. these findings imply that: (a) while evaluations of the truth of claims appear to be a component of fairness, considerations such as whether claims are the “whole story” or “relevant” to the decision at hand do not, and (b) contextualizing of the claims of ads in fact-checks has very little impact on perceptions of their fairness.",0
"current approaches to humanizing members of an outgroup in contexts marked by protracted intergroup conflict see mixed success. in both study 1, conducted on a random sample of israeli jews (n = 103), and study 2, conducted on a nationally diverse sample of israeli jews (n = 670), we experimentally test the effect of a unique approach to humanizing the outgroup based on empathy. instead of requiring individuals to express empathy for outgroup suffering they might have caused, this approach requires an expression of empathy for suffering unrelated to the conflict between the groups. results suggest that such an expression of empathy from one group member toward the other group can lead to “reciprocal empathy” which facilitates a greater willingness to accept the humanity of all members of the other group.",0
"experimentation is an increasingly popular method among political scientists. while experiments are highly advantageous for creating internally valid conclusions, they are often criticized for being low on external validity. critical to questions of external validity are the types of subjects who participate in a given experiment, with scholars typically arguing that samples of adults are more externally valid then student samples. despite the vociferousness of such arguments, these claims have received little empirical treatment. in this paper we empirically test for key differences between student and adult samples by conducting four parallel experiments on each of the three samples commonly used by political scientists. we find that our student and diverse, national adult sample behave consistently and in line with theoretical predictions once relevant moderators are taken into account. the same is not true for our adult convenience sample.",0
"this study examines how women's asset ownership is associated with children's nutritional status in papua new guinea, a country with some of the most severe child malnutrition in the world. the 2009–2010 household income and expenditure survey is employed, but restricted to children under the age of 72 months living with married mothers, leaving a final analytic sample of 1651. asset ownership is expected to strengthen mothers' income-generating capacity and their bargaining power within the home, which increases investments in children's health. women's ownership of fishing and agricultural equipment (important for meeting subsistence needs and for generating cash earnings) appears to be driving most of the results. ols regression results point to beneficial effects of maternal asset ownership for children's height-for-age, weight-for-height, and weight-for-age z-scores, and results from detailed quantile regressions indicate that these effects occur at various parts of the distribution, especially for children's waz scores.",1
"research on self-reported experiences of discrimination and health has grown in recent decades, but has largely focused on racial discrimination or overall mistreatment. less is known about reports of discrimination on the basis of socioeconomic status (ses), despite the fact that ses is one of the most powerful social determinants of health. we sought to examine the cross-sectional association between self-reported ses discrimination and subjective sleep quality, an emerging risk factor for disease. we further examined whether associations differed by race or ses. we used logistic and linear regression to analyze data from a population-based cohort of 425 african-american and white middle-aged adults (67.5% female) in the southeastern united states. ses discrimination was assessed with a modified experiences of discrimination scale and poor subjective sleep quality was assessed with the pittsburgh sleep quality index. in logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, and education, reports of ses discrimination were associated with poor sleep quality among african-americans (or = 2.39 95%, ci = 1.35, 4.24), but not whites (or = 1.03, 95% ci = 0.57, 1.87), and the race × ses discrimination interaction was significant at p = 0.04. after additional adjustments for reports of racial and gender discrimination, other psychosocial stressors, body mass index and depressive symptoms, ses discrimination remained a significant predictor of poor sleep among african-americans, but not whites. in contrast to findings by race, ses discrimination and sleep associations did not significantly differ by ses. findings suggest that reports of ses discrimination may be an important risk factor for subjective sleep quality among african-americans and support the need to consider the health impact of ses-related stressors in the context of race.",1
"health worker migration is an issue of first order concern in global health policy circles and continues to be the subject of much policy debate. in this paper, we contribute to the discussion by studying the impact of economic conditions on the migration of physicians from developing countries. to our knowledge, this is one of the first papers to do so. a major contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new panel dataset on migration to the us and the uk from 31 sub-saharan africa countries. the data spans the period 1975–2004. using this data, we estimate the impact of changes in economic conditions on physician migration. in our preferred specification that allows for country-specific time trends, we find that a temporary one percentage point decline in gdp per capita increases physician migration in the next period by approximately. 3 percent. in our iv models a one percentage point decline in gdp per capita increases physician migration in the next period by between 3.4 and 3.6 percent. overall, our results suggest a significant effect of developing country economic conditions on physician migration.",1
"given the increased access of antiretroviral therapy (art) throughout the developing world, what was once a terminal illness is now a chronic disease for those receiving treatment. this requires a paradigmatic shift in service provision for those affected by hiv/aids in low-resource settings. although there is a need for psychosocial support interventions for hiv-affected youth and their caregivers, to date there has been limited empirical evidence on the effectiveness of curriculum-based psychosocial support groups in hiv-affected families in low-income countries. therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility and assess the preliminary effectiveness of a psychosocial support group intervention for hiv-affected youth and their caregivers in central haiti. the study was conducted at six partners in health-affiliated sites between february 2006 and september 2008 and included quantitative as well as qualitative methods. hiv-affected youth (n = 168) and their caregivers (n = 130) completed a baseline structured questionnaire prior to participation in a psychosocial support group intervention. ninety-five percent of families completed the intervention and a follow-up questionnaire. psychological symptoms, psychosocial functioning, social support, and hiv-related stigma at baseline were compared with outcomes one year later. qualitative methods were also used to assess the participants' perspectives of the intervention. comparing pre- and post-intervention assessment, youth affected by hiv experienced decreased psychological symptoms as well as improved psychosocial functioning and social support. caregivers (95% hiv-positive) demonstrated a significant reduction in depressive symptoms, improved social support, and decreased hiv-related stigma. although further study is needed to assess effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial, corroborative findings from qualitative data reflected reduced psychological distress, less social isolation and greater hope for the future for families affected by hiv/aids following the intervention.",0
"this study investigates the relationship between business cycle fluctuations and health in the canadian context, given that a procyclical relationship between mortality rates and unemployment rates has already been well established in the u.s. literature. using a fixed effects model and provincial data over the period 1977–2009, we estimate the effect of unemployment rates on canadian age and gender specific mortality rates. consistent with u.s. results, there is some evidence of a strong procyclical pattern in the mortality rates of middle-aged canadians. we find that a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate lowers the predicted mortality rate of individuals in their 30s by nearly 2 percent. in contrast to the u.s. data, we do not find a significant cyclical pattern in the mortality rates of infants and seniors.",1
"based conceptually on problem behavior theory, normalization theory and theories of adolescent ethnic identity formation this study explores relationships between individual and cumulative multiple risk behaviors and suicidal ideation and behavior among mid-adolescents in three different populations in the middle east. data from the 2004 health behavior in school-aged children in the middle-east (hbsc-me) study included 8345 10th-grade pupils in three populations: jewish israelis (1770), arab israelis (2185), and palestinians in gaza and the west bank (4390). we considered risk behaviors and factors including tobacco use, bullying, medically-attended injuries, excessive time with friends, parental disconnectedness, negative school experience, truancy and poor academic performance. substantial population differences for suicidal tendency and risk behaviors were observed, with notably high levels of suicidal ideation and behavior among arab-israeli youth and higher levels of risk behaviors among the jewish and arab-israeli youth. for all populations suicidal tendency was at least 4 times higher among adolescents reporting 4+ risk behaviors, suggesting that similar psychosocial determinants affect patterns of risk behaviors and suicidal tendency. results highlight the importance of understanding cultural contexts of risk behaviors and suicidal ideation and behavior.",1
"although significant associations between childhood socio-economic status (ses) and adult mental disorders have been widely documented, ses has been defined using several different indicators often considered alone. little research has examined the relative importance of these different indicators in accounting for the overall associations of childhood ses with adult outcomes. nor has previous research distinguished associations of childhood ses with first onsets of mental disorders in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood from those with persistence of these disorders into adulthood in accounting for the overall associations between childhood ses and adult mental disorders. disaggregated data of this sort are presented here for the associations of childhood ses with a wide range of adult dsm-iv mental disorders in the us national comorbidity survey replication (ncs-r), a nationally-representative sample of 5692 adults. childhood ses was assessed retrospectively with information about parental education and occupation and childhood family financial adversity. associations of these indicators with first onset of 20 dsm-iv disorders that included anxiety, mood, behavioral, and substance disorders at different life-course stages (childhood, adolescence, early adulthood, and mid-later adulthood) and the persistence/severity of these disorders were examined using discrete-time survival analysis. lifetime disorders and their ages-of-onset were assessed retrospectively with the who composite international diagnostic interview. different aspects of childhood ses predicted onset, persistence, and severity of mental disorders. childhood financial hardship predicted onset of all classes of disorders at every life-course stage with odds-ratios (ors) of 1.7–2.3. childhood financial hardship was unrelated, in comparison, to disorder persistence or severity. low parental education, although unrelated to disorder onset, significantly predicted disorder persistence and severity, whereas parental occupation was unrelated to onset, persistence, or severity. some, but not all, of these associations were explained by other co-occurring childhood adversities. these specifications have important implications for mental health interventions targeting low-ses children.",1
"mental disorders are common in young people, yet many do not seek help. the use of psychiatric labels to describe mental disorders is associated with effective help-seeking choices, and is promoted in community awareness initiatives designed to improve help-seeking. however these labels may also be coupled with stigmatizing beliefs and therefore inhibit help-seeking: lay mental health or non-specific labels may be less harmful. we examined the association between labeling of mental disorders and stigma in youth using data from a national telephone survey of 2802 australians aged 12–25 years conducted from june 2006 to august 2006. label use and stigmatizing beliefs were assessed in response to vignettes of a young person experiencing depression, psychosis or social phobia. logistic regressions examined the association between a range of labels commonly used, including psychiatric labels, and a range of stigma components. there were no significant associations between label use and the stigma components of “stigma perceived in others”, “reluctance to disclose” and for the most part “social distance”. most mental health labels were associated with seeing the person as “sick” rather than “weak” and accurate psychiatric labels had the strongest effect sizes. however, for the psychosis vignette, the “dangerous/unpredictable” component was predicted by the labels “schizophrenia/psychosis”, “mental illness” and “psychological problem”, and the accurate psychiatric label showed the strongest association. for all vignettes, generic lay labels were not associated with stigma, but also rarely had a counter stigma effect. these findings suggest that the use of accurate psychiatric labels by young people is seldom associated with stigma and may assist young people by reducing perceptions of weakness. however, community education that promotes accurate labeling of psychosis should proceed with caution and address beliefs about dangerousness and unpredictability.",1
"we investigated the prospective impact of self-reported loneliness on all-cause mortality, mortality from ischemic disease and mortality from other cardiovascular diseases. we tested these effects through gee binomial regression models applied to longitudinal data from the alameda county study of persons aged 21 and over arranged into person-years. controlling for age and gender, the chances of all-cause mortality were significantly higher among respondents reporting that they often feel lonely compared to those who report that they never feel lonely. frequent loneliness was not significantly associated with mortality from ischemic heart disease but more than doubled the odds of mortality from other ailments of the circulatory system in models controlling for age and gender. subsequent models showed that physical activity and depression may be important mediators of loneliness-mortality associations. finally, we find support for the contention that chronic loneliness significantly increases risk of mortality but also find reason to believe that relatively recent changes in feelings of loneliness increase risk of mortality as well.",1
"this case study analyzes how and why student engagement differs across 581 classes in one diverse high school. factor analyses of surveys with 1,132 students suggest three types of engaging teaching practices-connective instruction, academic rigor, and lively teaching. multilevel regression analyses reveal that connective instruction predicts engagement more than seven times as strongly as academic rigor or lively teaching. embedded case studies of five classes use interviews and observations to examine how various classes combine connective instruction, academic rigor, and lively teaching and how these practices individually and collectively engage students. across these analyses, this study introduces a typology for thinking systematically about teaching for engagement.",1
"using data from south asia, this article examines how arranged marriage cultivates rivalry among sisters. during marriage search, parents with multiple daughters reduce the reservation quality for an older daughter's groom, rushing her marriage to allow sufficient time to marry off her younger sisters. relative to younger brothers, younger sisters increase a girl's marriage risk; relative to younger singleton sisters, younger twin sisters have the same effect. these effects intensify in marriage markets with lower sex ratios or greater parental involvement in marriage arrangements. in contrast, older sisters delay a girl's marriage. because girls leave school when they marry and face limited earning opportunities when they reach adulthood, the number of sisters has well-being consequences over the life cycle. younger sisters cause earlier school-leaving, lower literacy, a match to a husband with less education and a less skilled occupation, and (marginally) lower adult economic status. data from a broader set of countries indicate that these cross-sister pressures on marriage age are common throughout the developing world, although the schooling costs vary by setting. jel codes: j1, i25, o15.",1
"recent studies have identified correlational associations linking terrorism and females' standing in the labor market. theories have been proposed to explain these associations. some concluded that women's participation in the labor force could be the driver that moves terrorism; others proposed that terrorism motivates the deviations in the labor force. no study has adequately explored causality and the direction of this association. using a panel data set of 165 countries and terrorism data from 1980 to 2007, we find that terrorist attacks decrease female labor force participation and increase the gender gap between male and female labor force participation. by exploiting variation across countries and time, we are able to identify and quantify these effects; we are also able to address endogeneity concerns by using two novel instrumental variable approaches. the results are statistically significant and robust across a multitude of model specifications.",1
"this article introduces the continent of international law (coil) research project on international agreement design. coil stems from the conviction that the international organization subfield's focus on the couple hundred international organizations with physical headquarters had to be broadened to include the tens of thousands extant international agreements, that is, international law. each piece of international law can and should be studied as an institution. together, this set of institutions, which truly is a continent, is theoretically very interesting and empirically very diversified. coil's basic theoretical premise is that international agreement design and comparison across agreements begins by understanding the underlying cooperation problem(s) the agreements are trying to solve. coil identifies 12 distinct and recurrent cooperation problems, which may occur alone or in combinations. the data collection features a random sample of international agreements conditional on the issue areas of economics, environment, human rights, and security. the first large-n, systematic operationalization of the cooperation problems underlying real international agreements is highlighted, and descriptive statistics are presented - some of which challenge conventional wisdom. for instance, enforcement problems (prisoner's dilemma-like situations) are important, but far from universal, with 30% of the agreements characterized by that underlying problem. the numerous and diverse coil variables allow for a multi-dimensional operationalization of the difficult-to-measure concept of the incomplete contract. hypotheses from contract theory are tested, confirming the appropriateness of the new measure, the weakness of measures based on number of pages, and most significant, the rationality and efficiency of the continent of international law.",1
"gdp per capita and household survey means present conflicting pictures of the rate of economic development in emerging countries. one of the areas in which the national accounts-household surveys debate is key is the measurement of developing world poverty. we propose a data-driven method to assess the relative quality of gdp per capita and survey means by comparing them to the evolution of satellite-recorded nighttime lights. our main assumption, which is robust to a variety of specification checks, is that the measurement error in nighttime lights is unrelated to the measurement errors in either national accounts or survey means. we obtain estimates of weights on national accounts and survey means in an optimal proxy for true income; these weights are very large for national accounts and very modest for survey means. we conclusively reject the null hypothesis that the optimal weight on surveys is greater than the optimal weight on national accounts, and we generally fail to reject the null hypothesis that the optimal weight on surveys is zero. additionally, we provide evidence that national accounts are good indicators of desirable outcomes for the poor (such as longer life expectancy, better education and access to safe water), and we show that surveys appear to perform worse in developing countries that are richer and that are growing faster. therefore, we interpret our results as providing support for estimates of world poverty that are based on national accounts.",1
"while human capital is a strong predictor of economic development today, its importance for the industrial revolution has typically been assessed as minor. to resolve this puzzling contrast, we differentiate average human capital (literacy) from upper-tail knowledge. as a proxy for the historical presence of knowledge elites, we use city-level subscriptions to the famous encyclopedie in mid-18th century france. we show that subscriber density is a strong predictor of city growth after the onset of french industrialization. alternative measures of development such as soldier height, disposable income, and industrial activity confirm this pattern. initial literacy levels, on the other hand, are associated with development in the cross-section, but they do not predict growth. finally, by joining data on british patents with a large french firm survey from the 1840s, we shed light on the mechanism: upper-tail knowledge raised productivity in innovative industrial technology.",1
"we estimate the effect of new private-sector unionization on publicly traded firms' equity value in the united states over the 1961-1999 period using a newly assembled sample of national labor relations board (nlrb) representation elections matched to stock market data. event-study estimates show an average union effect on the equity value of the firm equivalent to $40,500 per unionized worker, an effect that takes 15 to 18 months after unionization to fully materialize, and one that could not be detected by a short-run event study. at the same time, point estimates from a regression discontinuity design-comparing the stock market impact of close union election wins to close losses-are considerably smaller and close to zero. we find a negative relationship between the cumulative abnormal returns and the vote share in support of the union, allowing us to reconcile these seemingly contradictory findings.",1
"managers often state that they are reluctant to vary prices for fear of ""antagonizing customers."" however, there is no empirical evidence that antagonizing customers through price adjustments reduces demand or profits. we use a 28-month randomized field experiment involving over 50,000 customers to investigate how customers react if they buy a product and later observe the same retailer selling it for less. we find that customers react by making fewer subsequent purchases from the firm. the effect is largest among the firm's most valuable customers: those whose prior purchases were most recent and at the highest prices.",1
"are cities as politically polarized as states and countries? ""no"" is the answer from our regression discontinuity design analysis, which shows that whether the mayor is a democrat or a republican does not affect the size of city government, the allocation of local public spending, or crime rates. however, there is a substantial incumbent effect for mayors. we investigate three mechanisms that could account for the striking lack of partisan impact at the local level, and find the most support for tiebout competition among localities within metropolitan areas.",1
we evaluate returns to general educational development (ged) certification for high school dropouts using state administrative data. we apply a fuzzy regression discontinuity method to account for test takers retaking the test. for women we find that ged certification has no statistically significant effect on either employment or earnings. for men we find a significant increase in earnings in the second year after taking the test but no impact in subsequent years. ged certification increases postsecondary school enrollment by 4-8 percentage points. our results differ from regression discontinuity approaches that fail to account for test retaking.,1
"we examine the effects of russia's 2001 flat rate income tax reform on consumption, income, and tax evasion. we use the gap between household expenditures and reported earnings as a proxy for tax evasion with data from a household panel for 1998-2004. we associate large and significant changes in tax evasion following the flat tax reform with changes in voluntary compliance. we develop a consumption-based framework to assess the deadweight loss from income tax in the presence of tax evasion and show that the efficiency gains from the reform are at least 30 percent smaller than the gains implied by conventional approaches.",1
"we study the short-term impact of connecticut's jobs first welfare reform experiment on women's labor supply and welfare participation decisions. a nonparametric optimizing model is shown to restrict the set of counterfactual choices compatible with each woman's actual choice. these revealed preference restrictions yield informative bounds on the frequency of several intensive and extensive margin responses to the experiment. we find that welfare reform induced many women to work but led some others to reduce their earnings in order to receive assistance. the bounds on this latter ""opt-in"" effect imply that intensive margin labor supply responses are nontrivial.",1
"we characterize the optimal default fund in a defined contribution (dc) pension plan. using detailed data on individuals' holdings inside and outside the pension system, we find substantial heterogeneity within and between passive and active investors in terms of labor income, financial wealth, and stock market participation. we build a life-cycle consumption-savings model, with a dc pension account and an opt-out/default choice, that produces realistic investor heterogeneity. relative to a common age-based allocation, implementing the optimal default asset allocation implies a welfare gain of 1.5% during retirement. much of the gain is attainable with a simple rule of thumb.",1
"we study the marginal tax rate incorporated into short-term municipal rates using municipal swap market data. using an affine model, we identify the marginal tax rate and the credit/liquidity spread in 1-week tax-exempt rates, as well as their associated risk premia. the marginal tax rate averages 38.0% and is related to stock, bond, and commodity returns. the tax risk premium is negative, consistent with the strong countercyclical nature of after-tax fixed-income cash flows. these results demonstrate that tax risk is a systematic asset pricing factor and help resolve the muni-bond puzzle.",1
"we explicitly consider financial leverage in a simple equity valuation model and study the cross-sectional implications of potential shareholder recovery upon resolution of financial distress. our model is capable of simultaneously explaining lower returns for financially distressed stocks, stronger book-to-market effects for firms with high default likelihood, and the concentration of momentum profits among low credit quality firms. the model further predicts (i) a hump-shaped relationship between value premium and default probability, and (ii) stronger momentum profits for nearly distressed firms with significant prospects for shareholder recovery. our empirical analysis strongly confirms these novel predictions.",1
"though a general consensus exists regarding the significance of perceived performance in voters' evaluations of incumbent governments, much of the research underlying this consensus has been carried out across political systems with little internal variance in the degree of democracy. we propose that in emerging regimes, where such uniformity in terms of the territorial diffusion of democracy is not a given, characteristics of subnational political regimes can prevent electoral linkages from forming. specifically, we argue that in subnational contexts where some minimal level of political competition has taken hold, performance-based linkages such as those driving economic voting should surface. however, in subnational dominant-party systems, where clientelistic linkages between voters and political bosses tend to prevail, economic performance and other aspects of an incumbent's governance record will be less consequential for the voting calculus of citizens, in both provincial and national elections. we find support for this theoretical framework in argentina and mexico, two democratic countries characterized by highly uneven subnational political contexts. by highlighting how subnational regime characteristics facilitate or undermine electoral accountability mechanisms, we cast light on the very real representational consequences of uneven democratization in emerging regimes.",1
"the relationship between international linkages and the nature and survival of political regimes has gained increasing attention in recent years, but remains one that is poorly understood. in this article, we make three central contributions to our understanding of international linkage politics and autocratic regime survival. first, we introduce and develop the concept of autocratic linkage, and highlight its importance for understanding the international politics of autocratic survival. second, we use event history analysis to demonstrate that autocratic linkage has a systematic effect on the duration of authoritarian regimes. finally, we complement our quantitative analysis with a focused comparison of autocratic linkage politics in the middle east. we show that variation in saudi arabian support for autocratic incumbents in the wake of the arab spring protests can be explained in significant part by variation in linkage relationships.",1
"the authors examine the effects of modernization and secularization on the vote for the religious party in the italian first republic (1948-1992). in addition to modernization and secularization, they also introduce two new factors to the analysis: the importance of institutionalized church and effects of the church's vatican ii reforms. italy is of particular relevance because of the centrality of the catholic religion in the italian society and politics, and the domination of the religious party-the christian democracy (democrazia cristiana; dc) in the country's party system until 1992. the authors analyze the impact on the dc vote of a series of indicators of modernization and secularization and of church organization and reform. the uniqueness of the analysis rests on the exceptional detailed and historical data for the italian commune (n = 6,140) across this time period and the use of advanced quantitative techniques. the analysis confirms the traditional interpretation of secularization but also stresses effects of the failure of the church's reforms of vatican ii. these reforms, which deemphasized the institutionalized church in favor of a more individualized, spiritual view, were intended as a response to modernization. instead, the reforms hastened the decline affiliated organizations and the religious party.",1
"the effect of policy regimes on immigrant incorporation has been the subject of extensive debate. despite much theoretical literature on the subject, the relationships between specific national policies in various domains and outcomes broadly related to social solidarity have not been well explored empirically. the present work develops measures tapping the priority of ""ascriptive"" traits defining membership in the national community. it tests the expectations of the theoretical literature on multiculturalism, citizenship policy, and social welfare redistribution against these measures across 18 immigrant-receiving democracies. cross-sectional analyses on, 2003 data indicate that both jus soli citizenship regimes and high levels of social spending are related to more immigrant-inclusive definitions of the national community, but the effect of multiculturalism is inconsistent. examined longitudinally, the effect of a jus soli citizenship regime and social spending remains consistent, but citizens in multicultural countries appear to have become substantially more ""ascriptive"" on these outcomes over time.",1
"the effectiveness of employment equity (ee) policies has been hindered by negative reactions to these policies. we draw on the self-enhancement literature to expand self-interest accounts of reactions to ee policies to explain inconsistent findings showing that both nonbeneficiaries and beneficiaries react negatively to ee policies. across four studies, we found that self-image threat influences reactions to gender-based ee policies. studies 1 and 2 established that ee policies threaten the self-images of both men (nonbeneficiaries) and women (beneficiaries). study 3 found that those least likely to experience self-image threat when faced with a gender-based ee policy are the most likely to show positive reactions to ee policies, while study 4 showed that both men and women react more favorably to ee policies when self-images threats are mitigated through a self-affirmation task. implications for our understanding of reactions to ee policies are discussed.

"are the traits preferred by voters also associated with success in political office? drawing on the ascription-actuality trait theory of leadership the present study examines whether traits ascribed to politicians predict leadership outcomes differently to the actual traits they possess. we collected self-ratings of politicians' personality (n = 138) using the neo-pi-r (actual traits) and observer ratings of politicians' facial appearance (ascribed traits) to examine their relationship with (a) leadership emergence, measured using share of vote in election, and (b) in-role leadership effectiveness, rated anonymously by political and local authority colleagues. facial appearance predicted leadership emergence but not effectiveness. personality had a more nuanced relationship with leadership outcomes. conscientiousness predicted effectiveness but not emergence, and agreeableness revealed a trait paradox, positively predicting emergence and negatively predicting effectiveness. these findings suggest a need to understand the contested nature of political leadership and qualities required for different aspects of political roles.",0
"we examined the influence of general mental ability, self-esteem and family socioeconomic status on leadership role occupancy and leader advancement (defined as the increase in supervisory scope via the number of employees supervised), as well as the moderating role of gender in these relationships. using a nationally representative sample from the u.s. with 1747 working individuals across a time span of 10 years, we found that 1) self-esteem had a significant and positive influence on leadership role occupancy for both males and females and on leadership advancement in terms of supervisory scope over time for females; and 2) family socioeconomic status exerted an adverse effect on female leadership advancement. the influence of general mental ability on the two leadership variables was not significant for either males or females, but the difference in its effect on the initial status of supervisory scope for males and females was significant. these results suggest that self-esteem plays an important role in leadership role occupancy and leader advancement and that the influence of family socioeconomic status on leader advancement is contingent on gender.

"dynamic theories of family size preferences posit that they are not a fixed and stable goal but rather are akin to a moving target that changes within individuals over time. nonetheless, in high-fertility contexts, changes in family size preferences tend to be attributed to low construct validity and measurement error instead of genuine revisions in preferences. to address the appropriateness of this incongruity, the present study examines evidence for the sequential model of fertility among a sample of young malawian women living in a context of transitioning fertility. using eight waves of closely spaced data and fixed-effects models, we find that these women frequently change their reported family size preferences and that these changes are often associated with changes in their relationship and reproductive circumstances. the predictability of change gives credence to the argument that ideal family size is a meaningful construct, even in this higher-fertility setting. changes are not equally predictable across all women, however, and gamma regression results demonstrate that women for whom reproduction is a more distant goal change their fertility preferences in less-predictable ways.",1
"many skilled professional occupations are characterized by an early period of intensive skill accumulation and career establishment. examples include law firm associates, surgical residents, and untenured faculty at research-intensive universities. high female exit rates are sometimes blamed on the inability of new mothers to survive the sustained negative productivity shock associated with childbearing and early childrearing in these environments. gender-neutral family policies have been adopted in some professions in an attempt to ""level the playing field."" the gender-neutral tenure clock stopping policies adopted by the majority of research-intensive universities in the united states in recent decades are an excellent example. but to date, there is no empirical evidence showing that these policies help women. using a unique dataset on the universe of assistant professor hires at top-50 economics departments from 1980-2005, we show that the adoption of gender-neutral tenure clock stopping policies substantially reduced female tenure rates while substantially increasing male tenure rates. however, these policies do not reduce the probability that either men or women eventually earn tenure in the profession.",1
"the past decades have seen a dramatic increase in the number of regulatory agencies ( ras) across countries and policy domains. to establish credible regulatory regimes, many ras are formally shielded from direct political influence and thus enjoy high levels of legal autonomy. while granting formal independence to an agency may erect some institutional barriers to politicization, it also generates a strong incentive to appoint ideologically likeminded individuals to the agency leadership. an analysis of about 700 top-level appointments to over 100 ras in 16 west european countries between 1996 and 2013 shows that individuals with ties to a government party are much more likely to be appointed as formal agency independence increases. higher levels of legal independence are thus associated with greater party politicization-a finding that casts doubt on the effectiveness of formal independence as a tool to reduce political influence in ras.",1
"studies of the association between innovation characteristics and innovation adoption at the level of organization are scarce. this study develops direct and moderating hypotheses for the relationship between innovation characteristics, manager characteristics, and innovation adoption in public organizations. the hypotheses are tested using survey data on the adoption of 25 innovations in 725 local governments in the united states and data from a panel of experts. the findings suggest that both innovation characteristics and manager characteristics influence the adoption of innovation; however, they do not reveal significant moderating effects of manager characteristics on the relationship between innovation characteristics and innovation adoption. the implications of the findings are discussed for further research on innovation adoption in the public sector.",1
"objective: negative body image is prevalent in women with rheumatoid arthritis and can affect other areas of well-being. patients have expressed desire for body image to be addressed in treatment. yet. it is not routinely addressed and no experimental intervention research has been conducted, until now. this randomized trial evaluated a brief online body image intervention for women with rheumatoid arthritis, with a focus on body functionality (everything the body is capable of doing) as the primary technique. method: women with rheumatoid arthritis and who wanted to feel better about their body (n = 84; m-age = 44.82) were randomized to the expand your horizon intervention (comprising 3 writing exercises focusing on body functionality) or a waitlist control group. primary outcomes concerned body image and secondary outcomes related to rheumatoid arthritis; these outcomes were assessed at pretest, posttest, and at 1-week and 1-month follow-up. results: multilevel modeling analyses showed that, relative to control, participants in the intervention experienced improvements in various aspects of body image (functionality appreciation, body appreciation, body satisfaction, body-self alienation) and decreases in depression, with effects persisting at 1-week and 1-month follow-up. no intervention effects were found for body-self harmony, rheumatoid arthritis-specific disability, pain-related disability, and anxiety. conclusions: focusing on body functionality can improve body image and reduce depression in women with rheumatoid arthritis. the intervention technique is easy and affordable to deliver and could be a fruitful addition to extant treatments for rheumatoid arthritis.",1
"empirical evidence of how citizens around the world understand democracy highlights the predominance of the liberal model of democracy. yet the existence of a dominant view does not mean that all citizens in every nation exclusively endorse a liberal conceptualization. hence, this article asks whether public beliefs about the meaning of democracy affect people's political attitudes and behaviors. using data from the 2006-2007 latin american public opinion project americasbarometer surveys, the author develops a taxonomy to categorize democratic conceptualizations in terms of structural complexity and substantive content. the author then examines the effects of the structure and substance of democratic conceptualizations on attitudes toward democracy and on patterns of political participation. findings indicate that variance in the structure of citizens' democratic conceptualizations brings several effects on political attitudes and behaviors. as to the substantive content of democratic conceptualizations, conceiving of democracy in terms other than liberty influences numerous aspects of citizens' attitudes and behaviors.",1
"based on narrative approaches, the authors develop an empirical technique to gauge the match between stories told by political actors and voters and assess its effect on voting behavior. even with other fundamental attitudinal and demographic factors held constant, they hypothesize that voters should prefer parties that hold and communicate similar national narratives. using data gathered during the 2009 elections to the israeli knesset, the authors gauge voter attitudes about fundamental national narratives in israel and conduct a systematic analysis of parties' discourse in parliamentary speeches to gauge parties' stories. controlling for demographics and ideology in a series of logistic regressions, the authors find that voting behavior for most parties is significantly affected by the narrative proximity between voters' stories and parties' stories.",1
"in this article, we describe results of a reanalysis of two randomized studies that tested the effects of enhanced anchored instruction (eai) on the fractions computation performance of students in special education resource rooms and inclusive mathematics classrooms. latent class analysis and latent transition analysis classified students according to error subtypes and tracked their performance patterns. results indicated that eai was more effective than business as usual in reducing combining errors (e.g., adding denominators) and denominator errors (e.g., not finding common denominator) of students with disabilities (swd) and students without disabilities in both settings. swd in inclusive classrooms scored higher on the pretest than swd in resource rooms, but eai reduced the disparity on the posttest. an important additional finding revealed that the swd who received more support from special education teachers in inclusive classrooms scored higher and made fewer errors than the swd who were provided only limited support.",0
"the article analyzes the diffusion of childbearing within cohabitation in norway, using municipality data over a 24-year period (1988-2011). research has found substantial spatial heterogeneity in this phenomenon but also substantial spatial correlation, and the prevalence of childbearing within cohabitation has increased significantly over time. we consider several theoretical perspectives and implement a spatial panel model that allows accounting for autocorrelation not only on the dependent variable but also on key explanatory variables, and hence identifies the key determinants of diffusion of childbearing within cohabitation across space and over time. we find only partial support for the second demographic transition as a theory able to explain the diffusion of childbearing within cohabitation. our results show that at least in the first phase of the diffusion (1988-1997), economic difficulties as measured by increased unemployment among men contributed to the diffusion of childbearing within cohabitation. however, the most important driver for childbearing within cohabitation is expansion in education for women.",1
"scholars of race have stressed the importance of thinking about race as a multidimensional construct, yet research on racial inequality does not routinely take this multidimensionality into account. we draw on data from the u.s. national longitudinal study of adolescent health to disentangle the effects of self-identifying as black and being classified by others as black on subsequently being arrested. results reveal that the odds of arrest are nearly three times higher for people who were classified by others as black, even if they did not identify themselves as black. by contrast, we find no effect of self-identifying as black among people who were not seen by others as black. these results suggest that racial perceptions play an important role in racial disparities in arrest rates and provide a useful analytical approach for disentangling the effects of race on other outcomes.",1
"research has examined the effect of family changes on housing transitions and childbearing patterns within various housing types. although most research has investigated how an event in one domain of family life depends on the current state in another domain, the interplay between them has been little studied. this study examines the interrelationships between childbearing decisions and housing transitions. we use rich longitudinal register data from finland and apply multilevel event history analysis to allow for multiple births and housing changes over the life course. we investigate the timing of fertility decisions and housing choices with respect to each other. we model childbearing and housing transitions jointly to control for time-invariant unobserved characteristics of women, which may simultaneously influence their fertility behavior and housing choices, and we show how joint modeling leads to a deeper understanding of the interplay between the two domains of family life.",1
"how large are the benefits of transportation infrastructure projects, and what explains these benefits? this paper uses archival data from colonial india to investigate the impact of india's vast railroad network. guided by four results from a general equilibrium trade model, i find that railroads: (1) decreased trade costs and interregional price gaps; (2) increased interregional and international trade; (3) increased real income levels; and (4) that a sufficient statistic for the effect of railroads on welfare in the model accounts well for the observed reduced-form impact of railroads on real income in the data.",1
"we find that greater institutional ownership is associated with more innovation. to explore the mechanism, we contrast the ""lazy manager"" hypothesis with a model where institutional owners increase innovation incentives through reducing career risks. the evidence favors career concerns. first, we find complementarity between institutional ownership and product market competition, whereas the lazy manager hypothesis predicts substitution. second, ceos are less likely to be fired in the face of profit downturns when institutional ownership is higher. finally, using instrumental variables, policy changes, and disaggregating by type of institutional owner, we argue that the effect of institutions on innovation is causal.

"the research on representative bureaucracy investigates whether higher levels of representation within public agencies affect policy outcomes. we expand this line of inquiry by examining the effect of symbolic representation on the clients' perceptions of the vocational rehabilitation program administered by the department of veterans affairs. we test the link between passive representation and symbolic representation for veteran identity. this is one of the first studies to investigate an identity not associated with immutable characteristics. we question how an identity related to a profession that an individual selects into, like veteran status, can influence a client's relationship with a government program. we find that veteran clients of the vocational rehabilitation system perceive substantial differences in the behaviors of their counselor and report significantly higher levels of overall satisfaction with the program when they know or believe their counselor is also a veteran.",1
"the empirical literature that examines cross-national patterns of state repression seeks to discover a set of political, economic, and social conditions that are consistently associated with government violations of human rights. null hypothesis significance testing is the most common way of examining the relationship between repression and concepts of interest, but we argue that it is inadequate for this goal, and has produced potentially misleading results. to remedy this deficiency in the literature we use cross-validation and random forests to determine the predictive power of measures of concepts the literature identifies as important causes of repression. we find that few of these measures are able to substantially improve the predictive power of statistical models of repression. further, the most studied concept in the literature, democratic political institutions, predicts certain kinds of repression much more accurately than others. we argue that this is due to conceptual and operational overlap between democracy and certain kinds of state repression. finally, we argue that the impressive performance of certain features of domestic legal systems, as well as some economic and demographic factors, justifies a stronger focus on these concepts in future studies of repression.",1
"whether elected representatives should be responsive to the wishes of the majority of citizens has been an issue often discussed from a normative perspective. this article shifts the focus by looking at the determinants of support for responsiveness among citizens. its core argument is that attitudes toward responsiveness vary systematically depending on the policy gains an individual can expect from a government that is responsive to the preferences of the majority of citizens. the analysis of data from the european social survey and 21 countries confirms these expectations. individuals whose ideological stances are reflected well by the incumbent government are less favorable to the idea that governments should be responsive to the preferences of the majority, while one's proximity to the ideological location of the median citizen increases the odds of support for majority responsiveness. our findings are stable across a large variety of european democracies.",1
"this article seeks to explain cross-country variation in noncompliance with european law. although noncompliance has not significantly increased over time, some european union member states violate european law more frequently than others. to account for the observed variance, the authors draw on three prominent approaches widely used in the compliance literature-enforcement, management, and legitimacy. they develop hypotheses for each of these approaches before combining them in theoretically consistent ways. they empirically test their hypotheses using a comprehensive data set of more than 6,300 violations of european law. the findings highlight the importance of combining the enforcement and management approaches. powerful member states are most likely to violate european law, whereas the best compliers are small countries with efficient bureaucracies. yet administrative capacity also matters for powerful member states. the united kingdom is much more compliant than italy, which commands similar political power but whose bureaucracy is far less efficient.",1
"several scholars have suggested that differential rates of summer learning loss contribute to the persistence of achievement gaps between students of different socioeconomic backgrounds. to better understand the possible determinants of summer learning loss, a test for summer-specific differences by socioeconomic status (ses) in children's time spent in activities related to cognitive development and parental time spent interacting with children is conducted using data from two time-diary surveys: the activity pattern survey of california children and the american time use study. tobit-model estimates provide evidence of statistically and practically significant summer-ses time-use gaps, most notably in children's television viewing.",1
"leader cognition proves to be central to organizational functioning as leaders generate solutions and provide direction when organizations encounter problems. this study examined the effects of utilizing different general thinking strategies for thinking through organizational problems on the formation of problem solutions and statements articulating a future vision. specifically, the effects of focusing on the positive, the negative, or balancing positivity and negativity were examined regarding their influence on the quality, originality, and elegance of solutions and the viability of vision statements. participants were asked to assume the role of a leader in an educational technology firm and provide a solution and vision statement to address the firm's challenges. the results revealed that a positivity strategy - thinking about positive outcomes and means for attaining success - resulted in lower quality solutions and less viable visions than a balanced positive-negative strategy either thinking about negative outcomes and means for attaining success or positive outcomes and means for avoiding failure. solution originality, however, was moderated by attribution of responsibility such that thinking about negative outcomes and avoiding failure resulted in more original solutions when responsibility for the conditions confronting the firm could be attributed externally rather than internally. the implications of these findings for understanding leader cognition and performance are discussed.

"in this paper, we use a social identity theory perspective to study the mechanisms through which internal and external corporate social responsibility (csr) influence employee identification and its subsequent outcomes, as well as the boundary conditions on these effects. we posit that csr actions focusing on external stakeholders enhance perceived prestige whereas csr actions focusing on employee welfare enhance perceived respect-both of which are argued to influence employee organizational identification but differentially impact different forms of employee citizenship. these relationships were predicted to vary in strength, however, due to individual differences in social (local vs. cosmopolitan) and cultural (individualist vs. collectivist) orientations. data are presented from 408 employees of a fast-moving consumer goods conglomerate operating in south asia (study 1) and from 415 employees spanning nine companies in two culturally distinct regions (france and pakistan, study 2). the results, which largely support our theoretical framework, are discussed in terms of their implications for both our understanding of the psychology of csr as well as social identity theory more generally.",1
"this paper provides a conceptual model that explains how competitive and institutional dynamics at the community level influence the ability of welfare-oriented nonprofits to eradicate income inequality. to test our framework, we build a large and unique seven-year panel dataset consisting of data from 245 u.s. communities. we find that increasing the number of welfare nonprofits is beneficial for reducing community inequality, but only up to a point, after which resource competition decreases their effectiveness. this competition for resources is also present when a high density of elite-oriented nonprofits operates in the same community. hypotheses focused on the institutional dimension receive mixed support. as predicted, welfare nonprofits are more effective when they operate in communities with strong law enforcement capabilities and less effective in politically conservative local contexts. contrary to our expectations, however, we find that welfare nonprofits are less effective in demographically heterogeneous local contexts and when the government provides effective social policies, thus indicating a possible substitution effect. surprisingly, nonprofit effectiveness is increased in highly financialized local contexts. together, our results indicate that issues of competition, institutional alignment, and community support in the context of grand challenges are more complex than originally thought.",1
"this study investigates the impact of early relationships on innovation at entrepreneurial firms. prior research has largely focused on the benefits of network ties, documenting the many advantages that accrue to firms embedded in a rich network of interorganizational relationships. in contrast, we build on research emphasizing potential drawbacks to examine how competitive exposure, enabled by powerful intermediaries, can inhibit innovation. we develop the concept of ""competitive information leakage,"" which occurs when firms are indirectly tied to their competitors via shared intermediary organizations. to test our theory, we examine every relationship between entrepreneurial firms and their venture capital investors in the minimally invasive surgical device segment of the medical device industry over a 22-year period. we find that indirect ties to competitors impede innovation, and that this effect is moderated by several factors related to the intermediary's opportunities and motivation to leak important information.",1
"we study how an individual's exposure to external information regulates the evaluation of entrepreneurial opportunities and entrepreneurial action. combining data from interviews, a survey, and a comprehensive web log of an online user community spanning eight years, we find that technical information shaped opportunity evaluation and that social information about user needs drove individuals to entrepreneurial action. our empirical findings suggest that reducing demand uncertainty is a central factor regulating entrepreneurial action, an insight that received theories of entrepreneurial action have so far overlooked.",1
"we tested the importance of two hypothesized resources-organizational inducements and employee psychological resilience-in determining employees' commitment to, and supportive behaviors for, organizational change. conducting a two-wave survey in a sample of 234 employees and 45 managers, we found that organizational inducements and resilience were positively related to two types of employees' commitment to change (normative and affective) and that these effects were mediated through state positive affect and social exchange. we also found that the two types of commitment to change were positively but differentially related to behavioral and creative support for change, and negatively related to turnover.",1
"publication bias involves the disproportionate representation of studies with large and significant effects in the published research. among other problems, publication bias results in inflated omnibus effect sizes in meta-analyses, giving the impression that interventions have stronger effects than they actually do. although evidence suggests that publication bias exists in other fields, research has not examined the issue in special education. in this study, we examined the inclusion of gray literature, testing for publication bias, the extent to which publication bias exists, the relation of including gray literature to the presence of publication bias, and differences in effect size magnitude for gray literature and published studies among 109 meta-analyses published in special education journals. we found the following: (a) 42% of meta-analyses included gray literature, (b) 33% examined publication bias, (c) meta-analyses not including gray literature were more likely to reflect publication bias, and (d) published studies had larger effect sizes than gray literature. we discuss implications and recommendations for research and practice.",1
"research on bullying is an important avenue for understanding the social integration of students in special education. focused on 3,305 students who self-reported victimization of two to three times per month or more, this study compared the pattern of verbal, relational, and physical bullying among students in general education and special education. overall, students in special education reported more physical and emotional harm as well as more psychological distress as a result of their victimization. self-reported rates of verbal and relational victimization were similar, but physical victimization was more often reported among students in special education. in addition, adult teachers and staff were more likely to verbally, relationally, and physically bully students in special education, according to student self-report.",1

"using data from the 1996-2008 panels of the survey of income and program participation and the 2009-2016 american community survey, we examine trends in u.s. children living in shared households (living with adults beyond their nuclear (parent/parent's partner/sibling) family). we find that although the share of children who lived in a shared household increased over this period, the rise was nearly entirely driven by an increase in three-generation/multigenerational households (coresident grandparent(s), parent(s), and child). in 1996, 5.7 % of children lived in a three-generation household; by 2016, 9.8 % did likewisemore than a 4 percentage point increase. more economically advantaged groups (older, more educated mothers, married households) experienced the largest percentage increase in three-generation coresidence, although correlates of coresidence remained largely stable. decomposition analyses suggest that the rise in social security receipt and changes in parental relationship status (less marriage, more single parenthood) most strongly explained the increase in three-generation households. given the dramatic rise in three-generation households, more research is needed to understand the consequences of these living arrangements for children, their parents, and their grandparents.",1
"despite abundant evidence about the effect of children's socioeconomic circumstances on their transition to adulthood, we know much less about the effect of social policy programs aimed at poor families with children in facilitating how and when children become adults. this issue is particularly important for the u.s. federal subsidized housing program given its long history of placing subsidized units in some of the poorest and most racially segregated neighborhoods. using counterfactual causal methods that adjust for the length of receipt of subsidized housing, i estimate the effect of subsidized housing on teenage parenthood, household formation, and educational attainment. i find that the subsidized housing program has either null or positive effects on the transition to adulthood and that these effects vary by both race and gender. these results underscore the importance of considering whether social programs have differential effects on the life chances of individuals based on both race and gender.",1
"the demographic literature on union formation in post-communist europe typically documents retreat from marriage and increase in cohabitation. however, sociological and anthropological studies of post-soviet central asia often point to a resurgence of various traditional norms and practices, including those surrounding marriage, that were suppressed under soviet rule. we engage these two perspectives on union formation by analyzing transition to first marriage in kyrgyzstan both before and after the collapse of the ussr. we use uniquely detailed marriage histories from a nationally representative survey conducted in the period 2011-2012 to examine the dynamics of traditional marital practices among that country's two main ethnic groups-kyrgyz and uzbeks-focusing on trends in arranged marriages and in marriages involving bride kidnapping. the analysis reveals instructive ethnic and period differences but also indicates an overall decline in the risks of both types of traditional marriage practices in the post-soviet era. in fact, although the decline has characterized all marriage types, it was more substantial for traditional marriages. we interpret these trends as evidence of continuing modernization of nuptiality behavior in the region.",1
"we study the relationship between polygyny and hiv infection using nationally representative survey data with linked serostatus information from 20 african countries. our results indicate that junior wives in polygynous unions are more likely to be hiv positive than spouses of monogamous men, but also that hiv prevalence is lower in populations with more polygyny. with these results in mind, we investigate four explanations for the contrasting individual- and ecological-level associations. these relate to (1) the adverse selection of hiv-positive women into polygynous unions, (2) the sexual network structure characteristic of polygyny, (3) the relatively low coital frequency in conjugal dyads of polygynous marriages (coital dilution), and (4) the restricted access to sexual partners for younger men in populations where polygynous men presumably monopolize the women in their community (monopolizing polygynists). we find evidence for some of these mechanisms, and together they support the proposition that polygynous marriage systems impede the spread of hiv. we relate these results to the debate about partnership concurrency as a primary behavioral driver for the fast propagation of hiv in some parts of sub-saharan africa.",0
"researchers continue to question fathers' willingness to report their biological children in surveys and the ability of surveys to adequately represent fathers. to address these concerns, this study evaluates the quality of men's fertility data in the 1979 and 1997 cohorts of the national longitudinal survey of youth (nlsy79 and nlsy97) and in the 2002 national survey of family growth (nsfg). comparing fertility rates in each survey with population rates based on data from vital statistics and the u.s. census bureau, we document how the incomplete reporting of births in different surveys varies according to men's characteristics, including their age, race, marital status, and birth cohort. in addition, we use monte carlo simulations based on the nsfg data to demonstrate how birth underreporting biases associations between early parenthood and its antecedents. we find that in the nsfg, roughly four out of five early births were reported; but in the nlsy79 and nlsy97, almost nine-tenths of early births were reported. in all three surveys, incomplete reporting was especially pronounced for nonmarital births. our results suggest that the quality of male fertility data is strongly linked to survey design and that it has implications for models of early male fertility.",1
"self-control problems change the logic of agency theory by partly aligning the interests of the firm and worker: both now value contracts that elicit future effort. findings from a year-long field experiment with full-time data entry workers support this idea. first, workers increase output by voluntarily choosing dominated contracts (which penalize low output but give no additional rewards for high output). second, effort increases closer to (randomly assigned) paydays. third, the contract and payday effects are strongly correlated within workers, and this correlation grows with experience. we suggest that workplace features such as high-powered incentives or effort monitoring may provide self-control benefits.",0
"objective: to estimate ptsd prevalence in parents of children with chronic illnesses or undergoing invasive procedures, and its association with higher risk of ptsd among parents. methods: sixteen studies reporting prevalence of ptsd in parents of children with chronic illnesses were identified through a systematic review in pubmed, web of science, pilots and psycinfo databases. main outcome measures: pooled current ptsd prevalence was calculated for parents from these studies. pooled pt sd prevalence ratios were obtained by comparing parents of children with chronic diseases with parents of healthy children. meta-regression was used to identify variables that could account for the lack of homogeneity. results: pooled ptsd prevalence was 19.6% in mothers, 11.6% in fathers, and 22.8% in parents in general (p < .001). pooled prevalence ratio for the four studies reporting on mothers and comparison healthy groups was 4.2 (p < .001). conclusions: the high prevalence of ptsd found in this population highlights the importance of promptly assessing and treating post-traumatic symptoms in parents of children with chronic diseases as a key step to prevent the negative consequences of ptsd and preserve their competency as caregivers.",0
"following grossman and rossi-hansberg (2008) we present a model in which tasks of varying complexity are matched to workers of varying skill in order to develop and test predictions regarding the effects of immigration and offshoring on us native-born workers. we find that immigrant and native-born workers do not compete much due to the fact that they tend to perform tasks at opposite ends of the task complexity spectrum, with offshore workers performing the tasks in the middle. an effect of offshoring and a positive effect of immigration on native-born employment suggest that immigration and offshoring improve industry efficiency.",1
"a novel experiment is used to show that the effect of a policy on the level of cooperation is greater when it is chosen democratically by the subjects than when it is exogenously imposed. in contrast to the previous literature, our experimental design allows us to control for selection effects (e.g., those who choose the policy may be affected differently by it). our finding implies that democratic institutions may affect behavior directly in addition to having effects through the choice of policies. our findings have implications for the generalizability of the results of randomized policy interventions.

"though political candidates, observers, and voters often express concern about partisan meddling in supposedly neutral elections, existing research has not directly studied partisan bias among election administrators. we report results from a field experiment conducted in wisconsin during the 2014 general election. local election clerks were sent an information request from a putative constituent, randomizing the sender's partisanship. our findings are mixed. overall, partisan email-writers were somewhat more likely to receive responses from local election clerks than email-writers who provided no partisan signal, though these effects are driven mostly by greater responsiveness to republican constituents. we also find some evidence of increased responsiveness to requests from copartisan constituents, particularly among republican municipalities. however, we find no evidence that local institutional context moderates the effects of the partisan treatments. our findings provide new evidence about the presence of partisan biases from administrators in ostensibly neutral settings and raise important questions about the capacity for insulating election administration from partisan influences.",1
"the establishment of a county charter, or ""home-rule"" provision, is intended to remove the resolution of local problems from the state legislature's busy agenda and give the county greater control over its regional affairs. although the literature has paid significant attention to the institutional determinants of local city structure and reform, little is understood about how and why a county would reform its governing system. for example, not all counties able to adopt a charter do so, nor are all adoption attempts successful. using an event history analysis approach and data of florida counties from 1973 through 2008, we draw on the theory of constitutional contracts to determine the demographic, economic, and political determinants of charter adoption.",1
"research on variation in policy implementation has examined how individual-and organizational-level variables shape discretionary practices at the frontlines of implementation but has given less attention to the influence of the organizational field. from an institutional logics perspective, the practices of street-level workers are likely to be more congruent with policy intent when policy is consistent with the core institutional logic that structures the organizational field. using data from a probability sample of 90 los angeles county hiv/aids health organizations and 216 frontline practitioners, our findings suggest that the extent to which implementation of hiv test counseling follows guidelines of the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) is related to consistency between cdc policy and core institutional logic, when accounting for individual-level factors such as client need; practitioners' professional orientation, knowledge, experience, and training; and organizational constraints such as workload pressures and formalization.",1
"multiple public administration survey research projects have asked respondents to assess the level of red tape in their organizations. many of these surveys use the following questionnaire item: ""if red tape is defined as 'burdensome rules and procedures that have negative effects on the organization's effectiveness,' how would you assess the level of red tape in your organization?"" unfortunately, no research has tested the ways in which the language used in this item may bias responses. this research uses data from a 2010 national survey of 2,500 local government managers in the united states to test three variations of the organizational red tape scale, investigating whether there is variation in perceived organizational red tape based on the question wording. the findings from this research contribute to the red tape literature by providing empirical evidence that the definition used in the organizational red tape scale, a commonly used questionnaire item in public administration research, influences responses about red tape perceptions.",0
"drawing on participant observation, in-depth interviews, and statistical analysis of administrative data, this article explores the operation of performance management in the florida welfare transition program and its effects on decisions to sanction welfare clients. unlike most econometric research on welfare sanctions, we approach sanctioning as an organized practice that reflects, not just client characteristics and behaviors, but also organizational needs, routines, values, authority relations, environments, and systems of reward and punishment. our analysis focuses on the organization of discipline and, in the process, suggests that scholars may misrepresent and misinterpret the incidence of discipline when they fail to account for the dynamic ways that organization and management shape sanctioning patterns.",1
"assuming elected politicians have some incentive to adopt public service management systems that will help secure their reelection, this article tests 11 hypotheses about political payoffs to incumbents from ambitious performance target systems. the data come from central performance targets for health and education in great britain in the early 2000s and are analyzed through a ""consilience"" approach that combines analysis of electoral and opinion poll data with analysis of press reports, legislative committee reports, organization of economic cooperation and development reports, and interviews with senior civil servants. this article uses the weaker target regimes used in scotland and wales as against england at that time to explore the difference targets made to credit obtained by incumbent politicians. we find little clear evidence for direct electoral benefits from the tough english targets and also little evidence for symbolic benefits for the incumbent government in support from other actors. these findings prompt questions as to why politicians should have invested significant time and political capital in such a public service management system.",0
"we use panel data on s&p 1500 companies to identify external network connections between directors and ceos. we find that firms with more powerful ceos are more likely to appoint directors with ties to the ceo. using changes in board composition due to director death and retirement for identification, we find that ceo-director ties reduce firm value, particularly in the absence of other governance mechanisms to substitute for board oversight. moreover, firms with more ceo-director ties engage in more value-destroying acquisitions. overall, our results suggest that network ties with the ceo weaken the intensity of board monitoring.",1
"we explored grade 6 students' (n = 202) self-efficacy, epistemic beliefs, and science interest over a 10-day virtual ecology curriculum. pre- and post-surveys were administered, and analyses revealed that (1) students became more self-efficacious about inquiring scientifically after participating in the activity; (2) students on average evinced a shift toward more constructivist views about the role of authority in justifying scientific claims; (3) students who identified more strongly with being a science person evinced greater gains in self-efficacy, developed a less constructivist view about the role of authority in justifying claims, and became more interested in science overall; and (4) students who held an incremental theory of ability evinced greater gains in self-efficacy. we discuss the implications of these findings for science educators and instructional designers in the design and use of immersive virtual worlds for middle school science students.

"the present study examined the role of preparing to teach (i.e., teaching expectancy) and actually teaching (i.e., explaining to others) on immediate and long-term learning. in experiment 1, participants studied a base version or an enhanced version of a paper-based lesson on how the doppler effect works with the expectation of taking a test on the material or with the expectation of teaching the material by providing a video-recorded lecture. results indicated that those who prepared to teach (without actually teaching) outperformed those who prepared for a test on an immediate comprehension test (i.e., a teaching expectancy effect; d = .55), regardless of the format of the lesson. in experiment 2, participants studied. while expecting to be tested or expecting to teach the material; some then actually did teach the material by providing a video-recorded lecture, whereas others received additional study time. results indicated that those who actually taught the material outperformed those who did not teach on a delayed comprehension test (i.e., a teaching effect; d = .56), though this effect was strongest for those who also prepared to teach. overall, these findings are consistent with the idea that preparing to teach results in short-term learning gains, whereas the act of teaching (i.e., by explaining the material to others) coupled with preparing to teach is important for long-term learning.

"this paper examines whether a party to a strategic alliance or joint venture suffers from spillover effects when the other partner files for bankruptcy. we find that the non-bankrupt strategic alliance partners, on average, experience a negative stock price reaction around their partner firm's bankruptcy filing announcement. this negative effect is strongest for longer partnerships and those with higher returns at the announcement of the initial alliance formation. furthermore, horizontal alliance firms in declining industries have lower returns, indicating that industry conditions can exacerbate expected problems for the non-bankrupt firm. non-bankrupt partners also experience drops in profit margins and investment levels in the subsequent two years with the worst performance concentrated among the longer-term agreements. there is very little impact on the returns or performance for joint venture partners, which suggests that these agreements are more insulating for the partner firm.

"in this paper, we show that the existence of a large, negative wealth shock and insufficient insurance against such a shock could explain both the limited stock market participation puzzle and the low-consumption-high-savings puzzle. we then conduct an empirical analysis on the relation between household portfolio choices and access to private insurance and various types of government safety nets. the empirical results demonstrate that a lack of insurance against large, negative wealth shocks is positively correlated with lower participation rates and higher saving rates. overall, the evidence suggests an important role of insurance in household investment and savings decisions.

"although meaningful assessment is considered the cornerstone of transition planning; little empirical guidance is available to inform this assessment process. this study examined the transition-related strengths and needs of 160 students with emotional and/or behavioral disorders (ebd) or learning disabilities (ld)from the perspectives of special educators, parents, and youth. teachers rated youth with ebd as evidencing more substantial needs than youth with ld across all 9 planning domains. students ratings were significantly higher than those of their teachers and parents. variability in the extent to which participants reported having sufficient information to assess each domain, as well as the extent to which they considered each domain to be relevant to planning, highlights the importance of incoporating multiple perspectives into transition planning.",1
"the prevalence of unauthorized downloading and duplication has been a serious ethical and financial threat. the current study explored the antecedents of digital piracy attitudes and intentions in a country with a high piracy rate. a structural equation model was proposed to investigate the interrelationships among the proposed antecedents and digital piracy intentions. the model was tested with 268 high school students, 610 undergraduate students and 406 adults. latent variables of interest were derived from the recent literature on piracy, which were facilitating conditions, optimism bias, previous experiences, prosecution risk, current habits, attitudes towards digital piracy and behavioral intention to conduct piracy. the model revealed a positive relationship between facilitating conditions and optimism bias. optimism bias and prior experiences had a positive relationship with current digital piracy habits, whereas prosecution risk had a decreasing influence on these habits. relationships among piracy habits, attitudes and intentions were significant as well. the structural equation model revealed acceptable and consistent fit values across three samples. findings maintain that further research may resort to the assumptions of the theory of planned behavior and the theory of reasoned action to explain the nature of behavioral intentions towards digital piracy and eliminate undesirable piracy acts.",1
"numerous studies have focused on the effects of exposure to air pollution on health; however, certain subsets of the population tend to be more exposed to such pollutants depending on their social or demographic characteristics. in addition, exposure to toxicants during pregnancy may play a deleterious role in fetal development as fetuses are especially vulnerable to external insults. the present study was carried out within the framework of the inma (infancia y medio ambiente or childhood and the environment) multicenter cohort study with the objective of identifying the social, demographic, and life-style factors associated with nitrogen dioxide (no2) exposure in the subjects in the cohort.

the study comprised 785 pregnant women who formed part of the inma cohort in valencia, spain. outdoor levels of no2 were measured at 93 sampling sites spread over the study area during four different sampling periods lasting 7 days each. multiple regression models were used for mapping outdoor no2 throughout the area. individual exposure was assigned as: 1) the estimated outdoor no2 levels at home, and 2) the average of estimated outdoor no2 levels at home and work, weighted according to the time spent in each environment. the subjects’ socio-demographic and life-style information was obtained through a questionnaire.

in the multiple linear analyses, the outdoor no2 levels assigned to each home were taken to be the dependent variable. other variables included in the model were: age, country of origin, smoking during pregnancy, parity, season of the year, and social class. these same variables remained in the model when the dependent variable was changed to the no2 levels adjusted for the subjects’ time-activity patterns.

we found that younger women, those coming from latin american countries, and those belonging to the lower social strata were exposed to higher no2 levels, both as measured outside their homes as well as when time-activity patterns were taken into account. these subgroups also have a higher probability of being exposed to no2 levels over 40 μg/m3, which is the annual limit for maximum safe exposure, as established by european directive 2008/50/ec.",1

"academic achievement in higher education is an important current policy issue because institutions are under public pressure to justify state subsidies and rising tuitions with demonstrable gains in student learning. this article uses data from three flagship public universities to examine the effects of financial aid on first-through fourth-year college grade point average. the findings indicate that need-based aid and merit-based aid both have positive effects throughout college, and thus colleges may be able to use financial policy levers to increase academic achievement. however, since the effect of merit aid is larger than that of need-based aid, institutions may have incentives to reallocate aid and admissions spots from needy to merit students unless appropriate safeguards are adopted.",1
"extending prior research on idiosyncratic deals (i-deals), in the current study we examine the functioning of i-deals in the context of leader-member exchange (lmx) differentiation. to that end, we integrate justice, social exchange, and social comparison theories and hypothesize that employee perceptions of their managers' procedural fairness and lmx quality partially mediate (in sequence) the positive relationship between i-deals and individual effectiveness, including job satisfaction, in-role performance, and helping behavior. furthermore, we propose that lmx differentiation moderates this mediated relationship, such that the mediation effect becomes stronger when lmx differentiation within the group is greater. data from a u.s. sample of 961 employees and their managers in 71 restaurants supported our hypothesized model. results shed light on managerial practices regarding how to gain positive effects from i-deals by considering the influence of lmx differentiation.

"the present research examined the effects of corporate executive officer (ceo) ethical leadership on the job pursuit attitudes and behaviors of prospective job applicants. furthermore, this paper tested two potential mediatory mechanisms for explaining why ceo ethicality matters to prospective applicants: perceived organizational reputation (study 1) and perceived value congruence with the ceo or person-ceo fit (study 2). the results of study 1 showed that job seekers at a career fair were more likely to apply for a job with an ethical ceo's company, compared to that of a morally-questionable ceo or one whose ethicality was unknown. the results also showed that perceived organizational reputation mediated the relationship between ceo ethicality and job pursuit these findings were replicated in study 2. in addition, study 2 showed that perceived value congruence with the ceo also mediated the link between ceo ethicality and job pursuit, although this effect was conditional on the honesty-humility personality of the prospective job applicant. these findings highlight the potential relevance of executive ethical leadership within the recruitment context (c) 2013 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.",1
"the development of adequate shared understanding of the task is of critical importance to group functioning. group leaders play an important role in this respect, as a key function of leadership is to shape group members' understanding of their job. in the present study we focus on decision making groups with distributed information and examine how group leaders shape members' mental representations of the group decision task through leadership behavior rooted in their own representations of the task. we propose that the extent to which the group leader has task representations that emphasize information exchange and integration affects group members' task representations, group information elaboration, and decision quality. we tested these hypotheses in an experiment (n=94 three-person groups) in which we manipulated whether a group leader was present and whether this leader held representations emphasizing information elaboration. results supported the hypotheses, and suggest that team leaders may play an important role in creating a socially shared understanding of team tasks.

"this study examines the consequences of status inconsistency for the performance of multi-unit organizations. status inconsistency refers to the extent to which social actors occupy status positions accorded different amounts of social esteem and prestige in different social systems. status inconsistency affects the performance of multi-unit organizations by weakening the well-established positive effects of status on performance because it creates status ambiguity that makes external evaluations of the organization and its individual units more difficult. distinguishing between high-status and low-status multi-unit organizations, we argue further that status inconsistency is particularly problematic for high-status multi-unit organizations, whereas low-status multi-unit organizations may actually benefit from status inconsistency. we test our arguments using a longitudinal sample comprised of 109 international business schools and their finance, accounting, marketing, management, and operations departments from 2002 to 2013. our study concludes with a discussion of the contributions our research makes to status theory and research, and the managerial relevance of our findings.",1
"this paper examines organizational learning in a target setting. organizations commonly set targets-explicit and quantitative reference points-for their operational units that reflect top management aspirations for these units. targets are commonly the outcome of a subjective process where supervisors combine their explicit and tacit knowledge to set performance expectations for their units. using a proprietary database from a large european travel company during a period of rapid expansion, we document the effect of organizational learning by studying how targets change as units mature. in particular, we examine managers' experiential learning from branches' past performance and their vicarious learning from branches in the same region in determining performance expectations over the life cycle of branches. our results indicate that, in setting performance targets, managers increase the weight of a branch's past performance and decrease the weight of comparable branches' performance as the branch matures. vicarious learning, where managers extrapolate the performance of comparable branches to a new branch, dominates in the early years. over time, this type of learning is replaced by experiential learning as experience accumulates. we document how early on in the life of branches, these two types of learning interact; this interaction disappears as branches mature. furthermore, we find that managers learn differently from successes and failures early in the lives of the new units, and this learning is affected by the magnitude of the successes and failures.",1
"does corporate philanthropy have an indiscriminately positive effect on recipients? our baseline argument asserts that relationships with stakeholders outside the field, such as corporate donors, can be perceived as a deviation from the dominant logic at the industry level, and thus as a negative signal by peers. how can recipients mitigate this adverse effect on social evaluations? to answer this question, we study how corporate benefaction affects the process of peer recognition in the context of russian theaters from 2004 to 2011. first, we engage in a qualitative exploration of our setting to contextualize our hypotheses and understand how relationships with corporate donors, depending on their characteristics, affect peer recognition. we then quantitatively test our hypotheses and confirm that the salience of the relationship with extraneous stakeholders-operationalized as the number of corporate donors-has a negative effect on peer recognition. however, we find that this effect can be mitigated if theaters choose to limit the breadth, depth, and negative valence of the relationship. we contribute to both the institutional logics and stakeholder literatures by bringing in a signaling perspective: we show that peer recognition, upon which themaintenance of a dominant logic lies, is directly impacted by the nature of relationships with extraneous stakeholders.",1
"the vertically integrated corporation of the 20th century has been replaced by disaggregated global supply chains across many industries. dis-integration can reduce costs, but also limits the ability to monitor and control critical processes, including labor practices and the sourcing of supplies. this article asks: what organizational factors distinguish corporations that are able to vouch for their supply chains from those that are not? section 1502 of the dodd frank act of 2010 gave companies over three years to determine and report on whether their products contained ""conflict minerals"" from the democratic republic of congo area. our analysis of every conflict minerals report submitted to the securities and exchange commission by over 1,300 corporations found that almost 80% admitted they were unable to determine the country of origin of such materials, and only 1% could certify themselves conflict-free with certainty beyond reasonable doubt. internationally diversified firms and those with large and more dispersed supply chains were less likely to declare their products conflict-free: complexity reduces the visibility of a firm's supply chain. our results suggest that widespread outsourcing may have reduced the corporate sector's capacity to account for the practices that yield its products.",1
"firms use repeated partnerships to gain benefits of shared experience such as improved coordination, collaboration, and adaptation. however, there are downsides to partnering repeatedly, including vulnerability to opportunistic partners upon whom the firm becomes dependent, muted efficiency incentives, and overlooking better options. this paper unpacks the effects of repeated partnerships by investigating their impact on two distinct types of performance: revenue and profitability. to understand repeated partnerships, we analyze a unique dataset of 580 partnerships that completed 144 bridge construction projects. controlling for project attributes that affect the level of outsourcing, we posit that a greater proportion of repeated partners and deeper relationships with these partners will result in greater revenue through winning bids, but that the prime contractor will not necessarily garner higher profits. we find support for these predictions, highlighting the trade-offs of repeated partnerships.",1
"despite the growing body of research on writing assessment, little attention has been devoted to developing and validating measures for beginning writers. this study examined the technical adequacy of a sentence writing measure with 233 students in kindergarten and first grade. the reliability, validity, and sensitivity to growth were investigated for production scores (words written, correctly spelled words, and correct word sequences) and for a novel qualitative score. most of the scores have promising alternate form reliability and criterion-related validity with noun-referenced writing assessments. in addition, all scores were sensitive to bimonthly growth and differentiated between students in kindergarten and first grade. the results indicated that the qualitative writing score may be a promising assessment for beginning writers.",1
"studies of the early-life origins of adult physical functioning and mortality have found that childhood health and socioeconomic context are important predictors, often irrespective of adult experiences. however, these studies have generally assessed functioning and mortality as distinct processes and used cross-sectional prevalence estimates that neglect the interplay of disability incidence, recovery, and mortality. here, we examine whether early-life disadvantages both shorten lives and increase the number and fraction of years lived with functional impairment. we also examine the degree to which educational attainment mediates and moderates the health consequences of early-life disadvantages. using the 1998-2008 health and retirement study, we examine these questions for non-hispanic whites and blacks aged 50-100 years using multistate life tables. within levels of educational attainment, adults from disadvantaged childhoods lived fewer total and active years, and spent a greater portion of life impaired compared with adults from advantaged childhoods. higher levels of education did not ameliorate the health consequences of disadvantaged childhoods. however, because education had a larger impact on health than did childhood socioeconomic context, adults from disadvantaged childhoods who achieved high education levels often had total and active life expectancies that were similar to or better than those of adults from advantaged childhoods who achieved low education levels.",1
"background. negative bias and aberrant neural processing of emotional faces are trait-marks of depression but findings in healthy high-risk groups are conflicting. methods. healthy middle-aged dizygotic twins (n = 42) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri): 22 twins had a co-twin history of depression (high-risk) and 20 were without co-twin history of depression (low-risk). during fmri, participants viewed fearful and happy faces while performing a gender discrimination task. after the scan, they were given a faces dot-probe task, a facial expression recognition task and questionnaires assessing mood, personality traits and coping. results. unexpectedly, high-risk twins showed reduced fear vigilance and lower recognition of fear and happiness relative to low-risk twins. during face processing in the scanner, high-risk twins displayed distinct negative functional coupling between the amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortex and pregenual anterior cingulate. this was accompanied by greater fear-specific fronto-temporal response and reduced fronto-occipital response to all emotional faces relative to baseline. the risk groups showed no differences in mood, subjective state or coping. conclusions. less susceptibility to fearful faces and negative cortico-limbic coupling during emotional face processing may reflect neurocognitive compensatory mechanisms in middle-aged dizygotic twins who remain healthy despite their familial risk of depression.",0
"background insomnia is a prevalent problem with a high burden of disease (e.g. reduced quality of life, reduced work capacity) and a high co-morbidity with other mental and somatic disorders. cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) is effective in the treatment of insomnia but is seldom offered. cbt delivered through the internet might be a more accessible alternative. in this study we examined the effectiveness of a guided internet-delivered cbt for adults with insomnia using a randomized controlled trial (rct). method a total of 118 patients, recruited from the general population, were randomized to the 6-week guided internet intervention (n=59) or to a wait-list control group (n=59). patients filled out an online questionnaire and a 7-day sleep diary before (t0) and after (t1) the 6-week period. the intervention group received a follow-up questionnaire 3 months after baseline (t2). results almost three-quarters (72.9%) of the patients completed the whole intervention. intention-to-treat (itt) analysis showed that the treatment had statistically significant medium to large effects (pd between 0.40 and 1.06), and resulted more often in clinically relevant changes, on all sleep and secondary outcomes with the exception of sleep onset latency (sol) and number of awakenings (na). there was a non-significant difference in the reduction in sleep medication between the intervention (a decrease of 6.8%) and control (an increase of 1.8%) groups (p=0.20). data on longer-term effects were inconclusive. conclusions this study adds to the growing body of literature that indicates that guided cbt for insomnia can be delivered through the internet. patients accept the format and their sleep improves.",0
"background. the mechanisms that contribute to emotion dysregulation in anxiety disorders are not well understood. two common disorders, generalized anxiety disorder (gad) and panic disorder (pd), were examined to test the hypothesis that both disorders are characterized by hypo-activation in prefrontal cortex (pfc) during emotion regulation. a competing hypothesis that gad in particular is characterized by pfc hyper-activation during emotion regulation (reflecting overactive top-down control) was also evaluated. method. twenty-two medication-free healthy control (hc), 23 gad, and 18 pd participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) during a task that required them to reappraise (i.e. reduce) or maintain emotional responses to negative images. results. gad participants reported the least reappraisal use in daily life, and reappraisal use was inversely associated with anxiety severity and functional impairment in these participants. during fmri, hcs demonstrated greater activation during both reappraisal and maintenance than either gad or pd participants (who did not differ) in brain areas important for emotion regulation (e. g. dorsolateral and dorsomedial pfc). furthermore, across all anxious participants, activation during reappraisal in dorsolateral and dorsomedial pfc was inversely associated with anxiety severity and functional impairment. conclusions. emotion dysregulation in gad and pd may be the consequence of pfc hypo-activation during emotion regulation, consistent with insufficient top-down control. the relationship between pfc hypo-activation and functional impairment suggests that the failure to engage pfc during emotion regulation may be part of the critical transition from dispositionally high anxiety to an anxiety disorder.",1
"background. the dsm-iv symptomatic criteria for major depression (md) derive primarily from clinical experience with modest empirical support. method. the sample studied included 1015 (518 males, 497 females) caucasian twins from a population-based registry who met criteria for md in the year prior to the interview. logistic regression analyses were conducted to compare the associations of : (1) single symptomatic criterion, (2) two groups of criteria reflecting cognitive and neurovegetative symptoms, with a wide range of potential validators including demographic factors, risk for future episodes, risk of md in the co-twin, characteristics of the depressive episode, the pattern of co-morbidity and personality traits. results. the individual symptomatic criteria showed widely varying associations with the pattern of co-morbidity, personality traits, features of the depressive episode and demographic characteristics. when examined separately, these two criteria groups showed robust differences in their patterns of association, with the validators with the cognitive criteria generally producing stronger associations than the neurovegetative. conclusions. among depressed individuals, individual dsm-iv symptomatic criteria differ substantially in their predictive relationship with a range of clinical validators. these results challenge the equivalence assumption for the symptomatic criteria for md and suggest a more than expected degree of 'covert' heterogeneity among these criteria. part of this heterogeneity is captured by the distinction between cognitive versus neurovegetative symptoms, with cognitive symptoms being more strongly associated with most clinically relevant characteristics. detailed psychometric evaluation of dsm-iv criteria is overdue.",0
"this study examined the relation of 3-year core information-processing abilities to lexical growth and development. the core abilities covered four domainsmemory, representational competence (cross-modal transfer), processing speed, and attention. lexical proficiency was assessed at 3 and 13years with the peabody picture vocabulary test (ppvt) and verbal fluency. the sample (n=128) consisted of 43 preterms (<1750g) and 85 full-terms. structural equation modeling indicated concurrent relations of toddler information processing and language proficiency and, independent of stability in language, direct predictive links between (a) 3-year cross-modal ability and 13-year ppvt and (b) 3-year processing speed and both 13-year measures, ppvt and verbal fluency. thus, toddler information processing was related to growth in lexical proficiency from 3 to 13years.",0
"chinese parents exert more control over children than do american parents. the current research examined whether this is due in part to chinese parents' feelings of worth being more contingent on children's performance. twice over a year, 215 mothers and children (m-age=12.86years) in china and the united states (european and african american) reported on psychologically controlling parenting. mothers also indicated the extent to which their worth is contingent on children's performance. psychologically controlling parenting was higher among chinese than american mothers, particularly european (vs. african) american mothers. chinese (vs. american) mothers' feelings of worth were more contingent on children's performance, with this contributing to their heightened psychological control relative to american mothers.",1
"to examine the unique functions of same- and cross-ethnic friendships, latino (n=536) and african american (n=396) sixth-grade students (m-age=11.5years) were recruited from 66 classrooms in 10 middle schools that varied in ethnic diversity. participants reported on the number of same- and cross-ethnic friends, perceived vulnerability, friendship quality, and the private regard dimension of ethnic identity. whereas same-ethnic friendships were uniquely associated with stronger private regard, more ethnic diversity and cross-ethnic friendships were uniquely associated with less perceived vulnerability. multilevel structural equation modeling tested whether cross-ethnic friendships mediated the diversity-vulnerability relation. although cross-ethnic friendships did not significantly mediate this relation at the classroom level, these friendships predicted less vulnerability at the individual student level.",1
"children aged 312 years (n = 184) with typical development, deafness, autism, or asperger syndrome took a series of theory-of-mind (tom) tasks to confirm and extend previous developmental scaling evidence. a new sarcasm task, in the format of h. m. wellman and d. lius (2004) 5-step tom scale, added a statistically reliable 6th step to the scale for all diagnostic groups. a key previous finding, divergence in task sequencing for children with autism, was confirmed. comparisons among diagnostic groups, controlling age, and language ability, showed that typical developers mastered the 6 tom steps ahead of each of the 3 disabled groups, with implications for tom theories. the final (sarcasm) task challenged even nondisabled 9-year-olds, demonstrating the new scales sensitivity to post-preschool tom growth.",0
"effortful control (ec), or the trait-like capacity to regulate dominant responses, has important implications for children's development. although genetic factors and parenting likely influence ec, few studies have examined whether they interact to predict its development. this study examined whether the drd4 exon iii variable number tandem repeat polymorphism moderated the relation between parenting and children's ec. three hundred and eighty-two 3-year-olds and primary caregivers completed behavioral tasks assessing children's ec and parenting. children's drd4 genotypes moderated the relation between parenting and ec: children with at least one 7-repeat allele displayed lower ec in the context of negative parenting than children without this allele. these findings suggest opportunities for modifying early risk for low ec.",0
"puberty is advanced by sex hormones, yet it is not clear how it is best measured. the interrelation of multiple indices of puberty was examined, including the pubertal development scale (pds), a picture-based interview about puberty (pbip), and a physical exam. these physical pubertal measures were then associated with basal hormones responsible for advancing puberty. participants included 160 early adolescents (82 boys). puberty indices were highly correlated with each other. the physical exam stages correlated well with boys' and girls' testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone and less so with girls' estradiol. the pds and pbip were similarly related to basal hormones. self-report may be adequate when precise agreement is unnecessary. multiple measures of puberty are viable options, each with respective strengths.",0
"the israeli matriculation certificate is a prerequisite for most postsecondary schooling. in a randomized trial, we attempted to increase certification rates among low-achievers with cash incentives. the experiment used a school-based randomization design offering awards to all who passed their exams in treated schools. this led to a substantial increase in certification rates for girls but had no effect on boys. affected girls had a relatively high ex ante chance of certification. the increase in girls' matriculation rates translated into an increased likelihood of college attendance. female matriculation rates increased partly because treated girls devoted extra time to exam preparation.

"the question of what is ""good"" or ""poor"" performance is difficult to answer without applying a reference point-a standard for comparison. citizens' evaluation of performance information will, therefore, tend to be guided by reference points. we test how reference points alter citizens' evaluation of organizational performance. in this article, drawing on herbert simon, we test how citizens use historical (internal) and social (external) reference points when making relative comparisons: how important is current performance relative to past performance? and how important is current performance relative to the performance of other organizations? two experiments are embedded within a large nationally representative sample of citizens (n = 3,443). the experiments assign historical and social reference points for performance data on education and unemployment to citizens. we find that citizens' performance evaluation is fundamentally a relative process. interestingly, we show that social reference points are almost twice as important in citizens' evaluations as historical reference points. we find some evidence of a negativity bias in citizens' relative evaluations. the strong social reference point effects have implications for studying citizens' response to performance and how managers can frame and manipulate external performance data.",1
"objective: with the inclusion of a dissociative subtype, recent changes to the dsm-5 diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) have emphasized the role of dissociation in the experience and treatment of the disorder. however, there is a lack of research exploring the clinical impact for highly dissociative groups receiving treatment for ptsd. the current study examined the presence and clinical impact of a dissociative subtype in a sample of individuals receiving treatment for chronic ptsd. method: this study used latent transition analyses (lta), an expanded form of latent profile analyses (lpa), to examine latent profiles of ptsd and dissociation symptoms before and after treatment for individuals (n = 200) receiving prolonged exposure (pe) or sertraline treatment for chronic ptsd. results: the best fitting lta model was one with a 4-class solution at both pretreatment and posttreatment. there was a latent class at pretreatment with higher levels of dissociative symptoms. however, this class was also marked by higher reexperiencing symptoms, and membership was not predicted by chronic child abuse. further, although those in the class were less likely to transition to the responder class overall, this was not the case for exposure-based treatment specifically. conclusion: these findings are not in line with the dissociative-subtype theoretical literature that proposes those who dissociate represent a clinically distinct group that may respond worse to exposure-based treatments for ptsd.",0
"objective: although efficacious interventions exist for childhood conduct problems, a majority of families in need of services do not receive them. to address problems of treatment access and adherence, innovative adaptations of current interventions are needed. this randomized control trial investigated the relative efficacy of a novel format of parent-child interaction therapy (pcit), a treatment for young children with conduct problems. method: eighty-one families with 3- to 6-year-old children (71.6% boys, 85.2% white) with diagnoses of oppositional defiant or conduct disorder were randomized to individual pcit (n = 42) or the novel format, group pcit. parents completed standardized measures of children's conduct problems, parenting stress, and social support at intake, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up. therapist ratings, parent attendance, and homework completion provided measures of treatment adherence. throughout treatment, parenting skills were assessed using the dyadic parent-child interaction coding system. results: parents in both group and individual pcit reported significant improvements from intake to posttreatment and follow-up in their children's conduct problems and adaptive functioning, as well as significant decreases in parenting stress. parents in both treatment conditions also showed significant improvements in their parenting skills. there were no interactions between time and treatment format. contrary to expectation, parents in group pcit did not experience greater social support or treatment adherence. conclusions: group pcit was not inferior to individual pcit and may be a valuable format to reach more families in need of services. future work should explore the efficiency and sustainability of group pcit in community settings.",1
"in the post-cold war period, civil wars are increasingly likely to end with peace settlements brokered by international actors who press for early elections. however, elections held soon after wars end, when political institutions remain weak, are associated with an increased likelihood of a return to violence. international actors have a double-edged influence over election timing and the risk of war, often promoting precarious military stalemates and early elections but sometimes also working to prevent a return to war through peacekeeping, institution building, and powersharing. in this article, we develop and test quantitatively a model of the causes of early elections as a building block in evaluating the larger effect of election timing on the return to war.",1
"when do states attack or consider attacking nuclear infrastructure in nonnuclear weapons states? despite the importance of this question, relatively little scholarly research has considered when and why countries target nuclear programs. the authors argue that states are likely to attack or consider attacking nuclear facilities when they are highly threatened by a particular country's acquisition of nuclear weapons. three factors increase the salience of the proliferation threat: (1) prior violent militarized conflict; (2) the presence of a highly autocratic proliferator; and (3) divergent foreign policy interests. the authors test these propositions using statistical analysis and a new data set on all instances when countries have struck or seriously considered striking other states' nuclear infrastructure between 1941 and 2000. the findings lend support for the theory and very little support for the alternative explanations. states are not deterred from attacking nuclear programs by the prospect of a military retaliation and concerns about international condemnation do not appear to influence the willingness to strike. ultimately, states are willing to accept substantial costs in attacking if they believe that a particular country's acquisition of nuclear weapons poses a significant threat to their security.",1
"the present study investigated the role of psychostimulants (methylphenidate, dexamphetamine; prescribed to participants for diagnosed attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; adhd) in reducing the negative effects of hyperactivity-inattention (h-i) on achievement through elementary school. whereas the bulk of research investigating h-i and medication has focused on students (conducting student-level analyses), research into classroom climates and processes suggests this issue be examined at both student- and classroom-levels. the sample comprised 54,165 australian students (from 5419 classrooms) for whom h-i data were available in kindergarten and achievement data were available in year 3 and year 5. in preliminary variance components analyses, findings showed there was notable variation in h-i and psychostimulant status from classroom to classroom. in multilevel path analysis, at both student- and class-levels psychostimulants reduced the negative effects of h-i on student achievement, to a level where h-i had no significant negative impact on achievement. these effects were not moderated by dosage or psychostimulant type. taken together, our findings add to the body of effective multi-modal educational and psychological interventions used to enhance the achievement outcomes of individual students who present with adhd and-of particular note and novelty in this study-the classrooms to which they belong.",1
"adding representational pictures (rps) to text-based items has been shown to improve students' test performance. focusing on potential explanations for this multimedia effect in testing, we propose two functions of rps in testing, namely, (1) a cognitive facilitation function and (2) a motivational function. we found empirical support for both functions in this computer-based classroom experiment with n = 410 fifth and sixth graders. all students answered 36 manipulated science items that either contained (text-picture) or did not contain (text-only) an rp that visualized the text information in the item stem. each student worked on both item types, following a rotated within-subject design. we measured students' (a) solution success, (b) time on task (tot), and identified (c) rapid-guessing behavior (rgb). we used generalized and linear mixed-effects models to investigate rps' impact on these outcome parameters and considered students' level of test engagement and item positions as covariates. the results indicate that (1) rps improved all students' performance across item positions in a comparable manner (multimedia effect in testing). (2) rps have the potential to accelerate item processing (cognitive facilitation function). (3) the presence of rps reduced students' rgb rates to a meaningful extent (motivational function). overall, our data indicate that rps may promote more reliable test scores, supporting a more valid interpretation of students' achievement levels.",1
"conflicting claims about important socio-scientific debates are proliferating in contemporary society. it is therefore important to understand the individual characteristics that predict learning from conflicting claims. we explored individuals' beliefs about the nature of knowledge and knowing (i.e., epistemic beliefs) and their emotions as potentially interrelated sets of learner characteristics that predict learning in such contexts. undergraduate university students (n = 282) self-reported their topic-specific epistemic beliefs and were given three conflicting texts about climate change to read. immediately after each of the three texts, participants self-reported the emotions they experienced. following reading and self-report, participants wrote summaries of the conflicting texts. text-mining and human coding were applied to summaries to construct two indices of learning from conflicting texts that reflected which source's information is privileged in memory. results from structural equation modeling revealed that epistemic beliefs were consistent in their predictions of emotions, which in turn variously predicted different learning outcomes. in particular, a belief that knowledge is justified by inquiry predicted surprise and curiosity, which at times facilitated learning. in contrast, confusion, predicted by passive reliance on external sources, related to impaired memory of conflicting content. theoretical and methodological implications are discussed for research on the relations between epistemic beliefs, emotions, and learning about controversial topics.

"using a multi-source, multi-measure research design involving 507 high school students and their teachers, we compared prediction of these students' academic achievement by a composite of students' and teachers' measures of students' self-regulation (sr) with a composite of students' and teachers' measures of students' self-discipline (sd). hierarchical regression analyses revealed that the sr composite was more predictive of students' grade point average and performance on a state-wide achievement test than the sd composite. confirmatory factor analyses showed that, although sd and sr latent factors correlated significantly, a two-factor solution provided an acceptable fit for the results. structural equation modeling analyses indicated that the sr latent factor predicted both measures of students' achievement significantly, but the sd factor did not predict either achievement measure significantly. no significant gender differences were found with students' sd, sr, or achievement measures. these results suggest a path for integrating two relatively separate streams in self-regulation research on the basis of a well-established distinction between learning and performance processes.

"this study identified decision-making profiles of students who make a choice of a major in higher education. these profiles were examined in a sample of belgian students at the end of grade 12, when the educational system expects that these adolescents choose a specific major. using latent class cluster analysis on adolescents' scores for coping with career decisional tasks (i.e., orientation, exploration, decisional status, and commitment), four clusters were identified. as expected, these profiles paralleled marcia's (1966) identity statuses (i.e., the achievement, moratorium, foreclosure, and diffusion status). results provided support for the external validity of the identified clusters through differential associations with several person variables (i.e., career decision-making self-efficacy, career choice anxiety, and decision-making style) and with academic functioning in higher education (i.e., commitment, academic and social adjustment). implications for current educational research and research on career decision-making are discussed.

"what can be done to promote student-instructor interaction in a large lecture class? one approach is to use a personal response system (or ""clickers"") in which students press a button on a hand-held remote control device corresponding to their answer to a multiple choice question projected on a screen, then see the class distribution of answers on a screen, and discuss the thinking that leads to the correct answer. students scored significantly higher on the course exams in a college-level educational psychology class when they used clickers to answer 2 to 4 questions per lecture (clicker group), as compared to an identical class with in-class questions presented without clickers (no-clicker group. d = 0.38) or with no in-class questions (control group, d = 0.40). the clicker treatment produced a gain of approximately 1/3 of a grade point over the no-clicker and control groups, which did not differ significantly from each other. results are consistent with the generative theory of learning, which predicts students in the clicker group are more cognitively engaged during learning.

"using data on identical and fraternal twins' complete financial portfolios, we decompose the cross-sectional variation in investor behavior. we find that a genetic factor explains about one-third of the variance in stock market participation and asset allocation. family environment has an effect on the behavior of young individuals, but this effect is not long-lasting and disappears as an individual gains experience. frequent contact among twins results in similar investment behavior beyond a genetic factor. twins who grew up in different environments still display similar investment behavior. our interpretation of a genetic component of the decision to invest in the stock market is that there are innate differences in factors affecting effective stock market participation costs. we attribute the genetic component of asset allocation the relative amount invested in equities and the portfolio volatility to genetic variation in risk preferences.

the main goals of this research are: (i) to explore the influence that announcement of certain type of online assessment has on students' learning strategies and (ii) to explore the influence of stimulated learning strategies on achievement levels that students exhibit during assessments. research has been conducted by testing and surveying 351 students from higher education institutions. results indicate that students' learning strategies can be influenced in a relatively short period of time by announcing various types of online assessments and that steering to more desirable deep learning strategies has positive impact on both formal and perceived levels of success in achieving the desired learning goals. these findings can be used to create a novel adaptive online assessment system that incorporates the elements of adaptivity within a series of assessments and uses post-assessment feedback to steer students’ learning strategies.,1
"many propose technology as a tool for empowerment of lower ses urban students, but little research has investigated the relationship between technology and empowerment for this population. we investigate how different aspects of technology use and ownership could empower urban youth through increasing their self-efficacy. instead of simply a general measure of self-efficacy, we focus on several important domains related to stem (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects including technological, mathematics/science, academic, and general self-efficacy. our investigation incorporates many aspects of technology use by considering first level digital divide characteristics, such as ownership and total amount of use, and second level digital divide characteristics, such as specific communication, multimedia, content creation, and social networking activities. we use a unique survey of fourth and fifth grade students who were given a laptop, thereby controlling for the typical disparity in computer ownership and access among lower ses students. we found that technology use influences each domain of efficacy in specific ways, indicating the importance of considering multiple domains of self-efficacy. most notably, frequency of communication and especially frequency of email use related to all four domains of efficacy and frequency of playing games related to general, mathematics/science, and academic efficacy. however, social networking activities had a negative association with academic and general efficacy. we conclude by considering the importance of multiple domains in self-efficacy research and policy implications for students and their schools.",1
"itunes university, a website with downloadable educational podcasts, can provide students the opportunity to obtain professors’ lectures when students are unable to attend class. to determine the effectiveness of audio lectures in higher education, undergraduate general psychology students participated in one of two conditions. in the lecture condition, participants listened to a 25-min lecture given in person by a professor using powerpoint slides. copies of the slides were given to aid note-taking. in the podcast condition, participants received a podcast of the same lecture along with the powerpoint handouts. participants in both conditions were instructed to keep a running log of study time and activities used in preparing for an exam. one week from the initial session students returned to take an exam on lecture content. results indicated that students in the podcast condition who took notes while listening to the podcast scored significantly higher than the lecture condition. the impact of mobile learning on classroom performance is discussed.",1
"although feedback is often seen as a critical component of the learning process, many open questions about how specific feedback features contribute to the effectiveness of feedback remain—especially in regards to peer feedback of writing. nelson and schunn (2009) identified several important features of peer feedback in their nature of feedback model. in the current study, we test an updated theoretical model that includes a broader set of features and considers not only students’ likelihood of implementing a comment but also the quality of their revisions. to empirically test the updated theoretical model, we analyze over 7,500 comments from 351 reviewers to 189 authors. each comment was coded for the presence of praise, a problem description, a suggested solution, localization, focus (i.e., low prose, high prose, substance), implementation, and revision quality. to account for the cross-classified nesting of data, we used a 2-level, cross-classified, hierarchical logistic regression model. only 2 feedback features increased students’ likelihood of implementation (i.e., overall praise and localization), while several feedback features reduced students’ likelihood of implementation (i.e., mitigating praise, solutions, and high-prose comments). overlapping feedback features affected students’ ability to revise and in opposing directions from their effect on likelihood of implementation: revisions were less likely to improve the quality of their paper when implementing comments that included a specific location in the text, but they were more likely to improve the quality of their paper when implementing comments that focused on high-prose and substance issues. implications of these findings are discussed.",1
"a body of literature suggests that ethnic heterogeneity limits economic growth. this article provides microeconometric evidence on the direct effect of ethnic divisions on productivity. in team production at a plant in kenya, an upstream worker supplies and distributes flowers to two downstream workers, who assemble them into bunches. the plant uses an essentially random rotation process to assign workers to positions, leading to three types of teams: (i) ethnically homogeneous teams, and teams in which (ii) one or (iii) both down-stream workers belong to a tribe in rivalry with the upstream worker's tribe. i find strong evidence that upstream workers undersupply non-coethnic down-stream workers (vertical discrimination) and shift flowers from non-coethnic to coethnic downstream workers (horizontal discrimination), at the cost of lower own pay and total output. a period of ethnic conflict following kenya's 2007 election led to a sharp increase in discrimination. in response, the plant began paying the two downstream workers for their combined output (team pay). this led to a modest output reduction in (i) and (iii) teams-as predicted by standard incentive models-but an increase in output in (ii) teams, and overall. workers' behavior before conflict, during conflict, and under team pay is predicted by a model of taste-based discrimination. my findings suggest that interethnic rivalries lower allocative efficiency in the private sector, that the economic costs of ethnic diversity vary with the political environment, and that in high-cost environments firms are forced to adopt ""second best"" policies to limit discrimination distortions.",1
"background auditory verbal hallucinations (avh) are common during development and may arise due to dysregulation in top-down processing of sensory input. this study was designed to examine the frequency and correlates of speech illusions measured using the white noise (wn) task in children from the general population. associations between speech illusions and putative risk factors for psychotic disorder and negative affect were examined. method a total of 1486 children aged 11-12 years of the copenhagen child cohort 2000 were examined with the wn task. psychotic experiences and negative affect were determined using the kiddie-sads-pl. register data described family history of mental disorders. exaggerated theory of mind functioning (hyper-tom) was measured by the tom storybook frederik. results a total of 145 (10%) children experienced speech illusions (hearing speech in the absence of speech stimuli), of which 102 (70%) experienced illusions perceived by the child as positive or negative (affectively salient). experiencing hallucinations during the last month was associated with affectively salient speech illusions in the wn task [general cognitive ability: adjusted odds ratio (aor) 2.01, 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.03-3.93]. negative affect, both last month and lifetime, was also associated with affectively salient speech illusions (aor 2.01, 95% ci 1.05-3.83 and aor 1.79, 95% ci 1.11-2.89, respectively). speech illusions were not associated with delusions, hyper-tom or family history of mental disorders. conclusions speech illusions were elicited in typically developing children in a wn-test paradigm, and point to an affective pathway to avh mediated by dysregulation in top-down processing of sensory input.",0
"background. although individuals vulnerable to psychosis show brain volumetric abnormalities, structural alterations underlying different probabilities for later transition are unknown. the present study addresses this issue by means of voxel-based morphometry (vbm). method. we investigated grey matter volume (gmv) abnormalities by comparing four neuroleptic-free groups: individuals with first episode of psychosis (fep) and with at-risk mental state (arms), with either long-term (arms-lt) or short-term arms (arms-st), compared to the healthy control (hc) group. using three-dimensional (3d) magnetic resonance imaging (mri), we examined 16 fep, 31 arms, clinically followed up for on average 3 months (arms-st, n=18) and 4.5 years (arms-lt, n=13), and 19 hc. results. the arms-st group showed less gmv in the right and left insula compared to the arms-lt (cohen's d 1.67) and fep groups (cohen's d 1.81) respectively. these gmv differences were correlated positively with global functioning in the whole arms group. insular alterations were associated with negative symptomatology in the whole arms group, and also with hallucinations in the arms-st and arms-lt subgroups. we found a significant effect of previous antipsychotic medication use on gmv abnormalities in the fep group. conclusions. gmv abnormalities in subjects at high clinical risk for psychosis are associated with negative and positive psychotic symptoms, and global functioning. alterations in the right insula are associated with a higher risk for transition to psychosis, and thus may be related to different transition probabilities.",0
"background. to evaluate the effectiveness of graded exercise therapy (get), counselling (couns) and usual care plus a cognitive behaviour therapy (cbt) booklet (buc) for people presenting with chronic fatigue in primary care. method. a randomized controlled trial in general practice. the main outcome measure was the change in the chalder fatigue score between baseline and 6 months. secondary outcomes included a measure of global outcome, including anxiety and depression, functional impairment and satisfaction. results. the reduction in mean chalder fatigue score at 6 months was 8.1 [95% confidence interval (ci) 6.6-10.4] for buc, 10.1 (95% ci 7.5-12.6) for get and 8.6 (95% ci 6.5-10.8) for couns. there were no significant differences in change scores between the three groups at the 6- or 12-month assessment. dissatisfaction with care was high. in relation to the buc group, the odds of dissatisfaction at the 12-month assessment were less for the get [odds ratio (or) 0.11, 95% ci 0.02-0.54, p = 0.01] and couns groups (or 0.13,95% ci 0.03-0.53, p = 0.004). conclusions. our evidence suggests that fatigue presented to general practitioners (gps) tends to remit over 6 months to a greater extent than found previously. compared to buc, those treated with graded exercise or counselling therapies were not significantly better with respect to the primary fatigue outcome, although they were less dissatisfied at 1 year. this evidence is generalizable nationally and internationally. we suggest that gps ask patients to return at 6 months if their fatigue does not remit, when therapy options can be discussed further.",1
"background. few studies have examined religiosity as a protective factor using a longitudinal design to predict resilience in persons at high risk for major depressive disorder (mdd). method. high-risk offspring selected for having a depressed parent and control offspring of non-depressed parents were evaluated for psychiatric disorders in childhood/adolescence and at 10-year and 20-year follow-ups. religious/spiritual importance, services attendance and negative life events (nles) were assessed at the 10-year follow-up. models tested differences in relationships between religiosity/spirituality and subsequent disorders among offspring based on parent depression status, history of prior mdd and level of nle exposure. resilience was defined as lower odds for disorders with greater religiosity/spirituality in higher-risk versus lower-risk offspring. results. increased attendance was associated with significantly reduced odds for mood disorder (by 43%) and any psychiatric disorder (by 53%) in all offspring; however, odds were significantly lower in offspring of non-depressed parents than in offspring of depressed parents. in analyses confined to offspring of depressed parents, those with high and those with average/low nle exposure were compared: increased attendance was associated with significantly reduced odds for mdd, mood disorder and any psychiatric disorder (by 76, 69 and 64% respectively) and increased importance was associated with significantly reduced odds for mood disorder (by 74%) only in offspring of depressed parents with high nle exposure. moreover, those associations differed significantly between offspring of depressed parents with high nle exposure and offspring of depressed parents with average/low nle exposure. conclusions. greater religiosity may contribute to development of resilience in certain high-risk individuals.",1
"background. the effects of cannabis use on neuropsychological indices that show characteristic disturbances in schizophrenia are unclear. the effect of cannabis use on these cognitive functions is of particular interest given the hypothesized association between cannabis use and schizophrenia. therefore, this study aimed to examine the effects of cannabis use on attentional control, working memory and executive functioning, in both healthy individuals and patients with schizophrenia. method. neuropsychological performance was assessed in 36 cannabis users who were otherwise healthy, 35 healthy non-users, 22 cannabis-using patients with schizophrenia, and 49 non-using patients with schizophrenia. participants were administered the stroop task, the letter-number sequencing and spatial span subtests of the wechsler memory scale, and the wisconsin card sorting test (wcst). results. patients with schizophrenia (both cannabis users and non-users) showed significantly poorer performance across all neuropsychological tasks, relative to controls; however, there were no significant differences between schizophrenic cannabis users and schizophrenic non-users on any measures, with the exception of increased non-perseverative errors on the wcst in cannabis-using patients. similarly, healthy cannabis users showed no significant differences from healthy non-users in any of the cognitive domains, with the exception of a schizophrenic-like increase in perseveration on the wcst. conclusions. amongst both healthy individuals and patients with schizophrenia there appears to be little difference in cognitive performance between cannabis users and non-users, suggesting that cannabis use has only subtle effects on the neurocognitive performance indices assessed here, which have been well established to be disturbed in schizophrenia.",1
"background. autistic spectrum disorder (asd) is characterized by stereotyped/obsessional behaviours and social and communicative deficits. however, there is significant variability in the clinical phenotype; for example, people with autism exhibit language delay whereas those with asperger syndrome do not. it remains unclear whether localized differences in brain anatomy are associated with variation in the clinical phenotype. method. we used voxel-based morphometry (vbm) to investigate brain anatomy in adults with asd. we included 65 adults diagnosed with asd (39 with asperger syndrome and 26 with autism) and 33 controls who did not differ significantly in age or gender. results. vbm revealed that subjects with asd had a significant reduction in grey-matter volume of medial temporal, fusiform and cerebellar regions, and in white matter of the brainstem and cerebellar regions. furthermore, within the subjects with asd, brain anatomy varied with clinical phenotype. those with autism demonstrated an increase in grey matter in frontal and temporal lobe regions that was not present in those with asperger syndrome. conclusions. adults with asd have significant differences from controls in the anatomy of brain regions implicated in behaviours characterizing the disorder, and this differs according to clinical subtype.",0
"the present 8-year longitudinal study examined how multiple aspects of family relationships change across the transition from adolescence (mage=15years) to young adulthood (mage=22years) among 821 individuals. results showed that there was more discontinuity than continuity in family relationships across this transition. whereas a normative decline was evident in all measured aspects of family relationships during adolescence, this decline persisted for only a few dimensions of family relationships during young adulthood. other aspects of family relationships stabilized or rebounded. there was little variation in these trajectories as a function of ethnicity or gender, suggesting that these changes in family relationships are generally normative. results suggest that the transition to adulthood is a period of significant transformation in family relationships.",1
"to test proposals regarding the hierarchical organization of adult attachment, this study examined developmental origins of generalized and romantic attachment representations and their concurrent associations with romantic functioning. participants (n = 112) in a 35-year prospective study completed the adult attachment interview (aai) and current relationship interview (cri). two-way analysis of variance tested interactive associations of aai and cri security with infant attachment, early parenting quality, preschool ego resiliency, adolescent friendship quality, and adult romantic functioning. both representations were associated with earlier parenting and core attachment-related romantic behavior, but romantic representations had distinctive links to ego resiliency and relationship-specific romantic behaviors. attachment representations were independent and did not interactively predict romantic functioning, suggesting that they confer somewhat distinctive benefits for romantic functioning.",0
"narcissisma strong need to be admired for a grandiose selfis a problematic personality trait for children as well as adults. this study of 236 preadolescents (m age = 11.3 years; 129 girls, 107 boys) evaluated 2 intrapersonal (cognitive) pathways by which narcissism might contribute to maladjustment. the first was that narcissism combines with salient self-serving gender stereotypes to encourage aggressive and selfish behavior. the second was that narcissism places children who perceive that they are failing to realize their grandiose self at risk for aggression and depression. although concurrent-correlational, the data support the pathways, illuminate the content and dynamics of narcissistic childrens minds, and suggest directions for future investigation.",0
"we examine the asset pricing implications of a production economy whose long-term growth prospects are endogenously determined by innovation and r&d. in equilibrium, r&d endogenously drives a small, persistent component in productivity that generates long-run uncertainty about economic growth. with recursive preferences, households fear that persistent downturns in economic growth are accompanied by low asset valuations and command high-risk premia in asset markets. empirically, we find substantial evidence for innovation-driven low-frequency movements in aggregate growth rates and asset market valuations. in short, equilibrium growth is risky.",1
"several studies have analyzed the impact of obesity on occupational standing. this study extends previous research by estimating the influence of body mass on occupational attainment over three decades of the career using data from the wisconsin longitudinal study. in a series of covariance structure analyses, we considered three mechanisms that may alter the career trajectories of heavy individuals: (1. employment-based discrimination, (2. educational attainment, and (3. marriage market processes. unlike previous studies, we found limited evidence that employment-based discrimination impaired the career trajectories of either men or women. instead, we found that heavy women received less post-secondary schooling than their thinner peers, which in turn adversely affected their occupational standing at each point in their careers.",1
"although previous research has established the association between early-grade mathematics knowledge and later mathematics achievement, few studies have measured mathematical skills prior to school entry, and few have investigated the predictive power of early gains in mathematics ability. the current paper relates mathematical skills measured at 54 months to adolescent mathematics achievement using multisite longitudinal data. we find that preschool mathematics ability predicts mathematics achievement through age 15, even after accounting for early reading, cognitive skills, and family and child characteristics. moreover, we find that growth in mathematical ability between age 54 months and first grade is an even stronger predictor of adolescent mathematics achievement. these results demonstrate the importance of prekindergarten mathematics knowledge and early math learning for later achievement.",1
"an adequate level of linguistic complexity in learning materials is believed to be of crucial importance for learning. the implication for school textbooks is that reading complexity should differ systematically between grade levels and between higher and lower tracks in line with what can be called the systematic complexification assumption. however, research has yet to test this hypothesis with a real-world sample of textbooks. in the present study, we used automatic measures from computational linguistic research to analyze 2,928 texts from geography textbooks from four publishers in germany in terms of their reading demands. we measured a wide range of lexical, syntactic, morphological, and cohesion-related features and developed text classification models for predicting the grade level (grades 5 to 10) and school track (academic vs. vocational) of the texts using these features. we also tested ten linguistic features that are considered to be particularly important for a reader's understanding. the results provided only partial support for systematic complexification. the text classification models showed accuracy rates that were clearly above chance but with considerable room for improvement. furthermore, there were significant differences across grade levels and school tracks for some of the ten linguistic features. finally, there were marked differences among publishers. the discussion outlines key components for a systematic research program on the causes and consequences of the lack of systematic complexification in reading materials.",1
"this study examined the influence of teachers' instructional moves on students' relational thinking during small-group collaborative discussions. one hundred and twenty 4th grade students and 6 teachers participated in a series of 10 discussions, generating a video-recorded corpus containing 32,511 turns for speaking. a microanalysis of a subset of the corpus showed that teacher prompts for relational thinking, rather than lower level prompts or prompts for evaluation, had an immediate effect on student relational thinking, triggering further relational thinking from students over several speaking turns. students were unlikely to emulate a teacher's relational thinking strategy but highly likely to emulate another student's. behavioral management but not cognitive management increased the likelihood of relational thinking. specific praise for cognitive or social strategies enhanced relational thinking, and the bidirectional association between praise and relational thinking suggested a transactional model of teacher-student interaction. the results underscore the importance of teacher influences in peer collaboration, even when the absolute rate of teacher talk is low.",0
"this experiment tested if a modified version of arithmetic practice facilitates understanding of math equivalence. children within 2nd-grade classrooms (n = 166) were randomly assigned to practice single-digit addition facts using 1 of 2 workbooks. in the control workbook, problems were presented in the traditional ""operations = answer"" format (e.g., 4 + 3 = _) and were organized pseudorandomly throughout the workbook. in the modified workbook, problems were presented with operations on the right side (e.g., _ = 4 + 3), the equal sign was sometimes replaced by relational words (e.g., ""is equal to""), and problems were organized by equivalent sums such that several problems in a row would all have the same sum. children who used the modified workbook constructed a better understanding of math equivalence than did children who used the control workbook. this advantage persisted approximately 5-6 months after the practice had ended, and there were no observed ""trade-offs"" with computational fluency. a mediation analysis showed that the modified practice improved understanding as intended by decreasing children's reliance on operational patterns. results suggest that small differences in the organization and format of arithmetic practice can yield substantial differences in children's understanding of fundamental mathematics concepts.",1
"classical educational research provides empirical evidence of the positive effect of doing homework on academic results. nonetheless, when this effect is analyzed in detail there are inconsistent, and in some cases, contradictory results. the central aim of this study was to systematically investigate the effect of homework on performance of students in mathematics and science using multilevel models. the original sample consisted of 7,725 spanish adolescents with a mean age of 13.78 (+/- 0.82) of which 7,451 were evaluated after purging the sample of the students who did little to no homework. a 2-level hierarchical-linear analysis was performed, student and class, with 4 individual adjustment variables: gender, socioeconomic and cultural level, year repetition, and school grades, which were used to reflect previous student achievement. the individual level examined time spent, effort made, and the way homework was done. the class level considered frequency of assignment and quantity of homework. prior knowledge, estimated using school grades, is shown to be the most important predictor of achievement in the study. its effect is greater than the combined effect of all the other variables studied. once background factors are controlled, the homework variables with most impact on the test are student autonomy and frequency of homework assignment by teachers. autonomy when doing homework was shown to be the most important individual-level variable in both mathematics and science, and not effort and or time spent doing homework. the optimum duration of homework was found to be 1 hr a day.",1
"we examined the impact of a teacher-led intervention, implemented during regular classroom instruction and homework, on fourth-grade students' preference for self-regulated learning, finding main ideas in expository texts, and reading comprehension. in our quasi-experimental study with intact classrooms, (a) students (n = 266, 12 classrooms) who received regular classroom instruction (reg) were compared with (b) students (n = 268, 12 classrooms) who were taught text reduction strategies (text) and (c) students (n = 229, 9 classrooms) who were introduced to text reduction strategies within the framework of a 7-step cyclical model of self-regulated learning (srl = text). participating classrooms were semi-randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 conditions, with the restriction that teachers from one school could not be in different intervention conditions. both in their posttest and follow-up test results (11 weeks after the intervention), srl + text students showed a stronger preference for self-regulated learning than students of the 2 other groups. the srl + text students also identified more main ideas over the course of the intervention. positive effects on reading comprehension in a standardized test were restricted to students without migration background.",0
"two previous studies examining 5 empirical educational psychology research journals (hsieh et al., 2005; robinson, levin, thomas, pituch, & vaughn, 2007) found that in the 21-year period from 1983 to 2004, there was a decrease in intervention and randomized experimental research, whereas in the 10-year period from 1994 to 2004, there was an increase in recommendations for practice based on nonintervention observational/correlational research. the present study extends this research to determine the extent to which statistical modeling analyses were conducted in articles published in the 10-year period from 2000 to 2010. the aforementioned trends continued: in 2010, only 23% of the published empirical research studies used random assignment, and 46% of nonintervention. observational/correlational articles included recommendations for practice. additionally, the percentage of the latter articles that used statistical modeling analyses increased from 15% in 2000 to 54% in 2010. moreover, across the 2 time periods, observational/correlational articles that incorporated modeling analyses were about 1.7 times more likely to contain recommendations for practice than such articles that did not incorporate modeling analyses (59% vs. 35%, respectively). these findings suggest that educational researchers may be overstepping the warrants of statistical modeling techniques by using them to confirm, rather than simply to disconfirm, causal hypotheses derived from correlational data (whitehurst, 2003).",0
"conceptual change is a gradual process that occurs as students integrate new information into their existing conceptions. throughout this process, assessing learning requires measures to diagnose misconceptions and understand how knowledge is changing. we developed, three measures of misconceptions to assess students' knowledge early in instruction on decimals that measured the: 1) prevalence of misconception errors based on response patterns, 2) existence of misconceptions in a more abstract context, and 3) strength of misconceptions using confidence ratings. students ages 9-11 (n = 297) completed the assessment at three time points. these measures revealed that whole number and role of zero misconceptions decreased and fraction misconceptions increased over time. the current measures also differentiated between weaker misconceptions that were changed after brief instruction and strongly held misconceptions. the current measures can create a more complete picture of knowledge than only measuring students' accuracy, providing a window into the conceptual change process.

"this paper examines how industrial policy specifically tariff liberalization and tax subsidies affects the magnitude and direction of fdi spillovers. we examine these spillover effects across the diverse ownership structure of china's manufacturing sector for 1998 through 2007. we find that tariff reforms, particularly tariff reductions associated with china's wto ascension, increased the productivity impacts of fdi's backward spillovers. tax policy both corporate income and vat subsidies has seemingly drawn fdi into strategic industries that spawn significant vertical spillovers. we conclude that liberalization measures during the critical 1998-2007 period on balance served to enhance productivity growth in chinese industry.

"we examine how unfavorable social comparisons differentially spur employees of varying hierarchical levels to engage in deception. drawing on literatures in social psychology and workplace self-esteem, we theorize that negative comparisons cause senior employees to seek to improve reported relative performance measures via deception. in a first study, we use deceptive self-downloads on the social science research network, the leading working paper repository in the social sciences, to show that employees higher in a hierarchy are more likely to engage in deception, particularly when the employee has enjoyed a high level of past success. in a second study, we confirm this finding in two scenario-based experiments. our results suggest that longer-tenured and more successful employees face a greater loss of self-esteem from negative social comparisons, and they are more likely engage in deception in response to reported performance that is lower than that of peers.",1
"this article builds on an important but underdeveloped social science concept — the “scene” as a cluster of urban amenities — to contribute to social science theory and subspecialties such as urban and rural, class, race and gender studies. scenes grow more important in less industrial, more expressively-oriented and contingent societies where traditional constraints fall and self-motivated action around consumption, leisure and amenities is a more important feature of social cohesiveness and interaction. scenes contextualize the individual through amenities and consumption-based expressions of shared sensibilities as to what is right, beautiful and genuine. this framework adds to concepts such as neighborhood and workplace by specifying 15 dimensions of the urban scenescape. like neighborhood and workplace, scenes reduce anomie, but because of their focus on consumption and the use of specific amenities, they are more consistent with today's ethos of contingency, moving beyond traditional ideas of the fundamental power of social, family and occupational background. we introduce a new amenities-focused database to measure and analyze scenes and their dimensions for each of 40,000 u.s. zip codes. we illustrate the framework by applying it to one distinct type of scene, bohemia, and analyze its position in the broader social system.",1
"the overrepresentation of students from minority ethnic groups in separate special education settings' has been extensively documented in north america, yet little research exists for australian school systems. the authors of this study systematically analyzed 13 years of enrollment data from the state of new south wales and found stark, increasing differences in patterns of enrollment between indigenous students, students from a language background other than english (lbote), and non-indigenous english-speaking students. although enrollments of indigenous students in separate settings increased faster across time than did enrollments of indigenous students in mainstream, enrollments of lbote students in mainstream increased faster than did enrollments of lbote students in separate settings.",1
"over 130,000 juveniles are detained in the united states each year with 70,000 in detention on any given day, yet little is known about whether such a penalty deters future crime or interrupts social and human capital formation in a way that increases the likelihood of later criminal behavior. this article uses the incarceration tendency of randomly assigned judges as an instrumental variable to estimate causal effects of juvenile incarceration on high school completion and adult recidivism. estimates based on over 35,000 juvenile offenders over a 10-year period from a large urban county in the united states suggest that juvenile incarceration results in substantially lower high school completion rates and higher adult incarceration rates, including for violent crimes. in an attempt to understand the large effects, we found that incarceration for this population could be very disruptive, greatly reducing the likelihood of ever returning to school and, for those who do return, significantly increasing the likelihood of being classified as having an emotional or behavioral disorder.",1
"this experimental study evaluated a model in which the delivery of a supplemental beginning reading intervention was adjusted based on student performance. kindergarten students identified as at risk for reading difficulties were assigned to one of two versions of the early reading intervention (eri; pearson/scott foresman, 2004). students assigned to the experimental condition received the intervention with systematic adjustments based on student performance. students in the comparison condition received the same intervention without instructional modifications. the experimental group outperformed the comparison group on all posttest measures at the end of kindergarten. follow-up analyses at the end of first grade revealed a continued advantage for the experimental group. findings suggest that systematically adjusting intervention support in response to student performance may be feasible and efficacious.",1
"this study investigated the impact of different modes of scaffolding on students who are learning science through a web-based collaborative inquiry project in authentic classroom settings and explored the interaction effects with students’ characteristics. the intervention study aimed to improve domain-specific knowledge and metacognitive awareness during online information problem solving (ips) as part of an online inquiry project. three experimental conditions (teacher-enhanced scaffolding, technology-enhanced scaffolding, and both forms of scaffolding) were compared with a control condition in a two-by-two factorial quasi-experimental design. moreover, gender and prior knowledge were examined as two factors which may have a significant impact on web-based learning. in a four-week field study in secondary science education, pretest-posttest differences were measured. in total 347 students from 18 secondary school classes were involved and the classes were randomly distributed over the 4 conditions. our findings support the notion of multiple scaffolding as an approach to enhance both knowledge acquisition and metacognitive awareness with respect to ips-processes and to meet a mix of students with different needs within the context of a web-based inquiry learning project.",1
"the power of a web-based forensic science game to teach content and motivate stem careers was tested among secondary students. more than 700 secondary school students were exposed to one of the three web-based forensic cases for approximately 60 min. gain scores from pre-test to a delayed post-test indicated significant gains in content knowledge. in addition, the game’s usability ratings were a strong predictor of learning. a positive relationship between role-play experience and science career motivation was observed, which suggests a role for authentic virtual experiences in inspiring students to consider stem careers.",1
"the present study used cross‐lagged panel analyses to test longitudinal associations among emotion regulation, prefrontal cortex (pfc) function, and depression severity in adolescent girls. the ventromedial and dorsomedial pfc (vmpfc and dmpfc) were regions of interest given their roles in depression pathophysiology, self‐referential processing, and emotion regulation. at ages 16 and 17, seventy‐eight girls completed a neuroimaging scan to assess changes in vmpfc and dmpfc activation to sad faces, and measures of depressive symptom severity and emotion regulation. the 1‐year cross‐lagged effects of dmpfc activity at age 16 on expressive suppression at age 17 and depressive symptomatology at age 17 were significant, demonstrating a predictive relation between dmpfc activity and both suppression and depressive severity.",1
"this study used short‐term longitudinal data to examine the contributions of democratic teaching practices (e.g., the developmental designs approach) and equitable school climate to civic engagement attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors among 515 black and latino middle school students (47.9% male). concurrent experiences of democratic homeroom and classroom practices, and equitable school climate were associated with higher scores on each civic engagement component. the relation between classroom practices and civic attitudes was more robust when school climate was seen as more equitable. longitudinally, homeroom practices and equitable school climate predicted higher civic attitudes 1 year later. discussion focuses on civic attitudes and future research on school experiences that support civic engagement among youth of color.",1
"a nap soon after encoding leads to better learning in infancy. however, whether napping plays the same role in preschoolers' learning is unclear. in experiment 1 (n  = 39), 3‐year‐old habitual and nonhabitual nappers learned novel verbs before a nap or a period of wakefulness and received a generalization test examining word extension to novel actors after 24 hr. only habitual and nonhabitual nappers who napped after learning generalized 24 hr later. in experiment 2 (n  = 40), children learned the same verbs but were tested within 2–3 min of training. here, habitual and nonhabitual nappers retained the mappings but did not generalize. the results suggest that naps consolidate weak learning that habitual and nonhabitual nappers would otherwise forget over periods of wakefulness.",1
"binding is key in multisensory perception. this study investigated the audio‐visual (a‐v) temporal binding window in 4‐, 5‐, and 6‐year‐old children (total n  = 120). children watched a person uttering a syllable whose auditory and visual components were either temporally synchronized or desynchronized by 366, 500, or 666 ms. they were asked whether the voice and face went together (experiment 1) or whether the desynchronized videos differed from the synchronized one (experiment 2). four‐year‐olds detected the 666‐ms asynchrony, 5‐year‐olds detected the 666‐ and 500‐ms asynchrony, and 6‐year‐olds detected all asynchronies. these results show that the a‐v temporal binding window narrows slowly during early childhood and that it is still wider at 6 years of age than in older children and adults.",1
"the aim of the longitudinal study was to investigate whether a computer application designed for remedial reading training can enhance letter knowledge, reading accuracy, fluency, and spelling of at‐risk children. the participants, 7‐year‐old finnish school beginners (n  = 166), were assigned to 1 of 3 groups: (a) regular remedial reading intervention (n  = 25), (b) computer‐assessed reading intervention (n  = 25), and (c) mainstream reading instruction (n  = 116). based on the results, computer‐assisted remedial reading intervention was highly beneficial, whereas regular type of intervention was less successful. the results indicated that at‐risk children require computer‐based letter–name and letter–sound training to acquire adequate decoding and spelling skills, and to reach the level of their non‐at‐risk peers.",1
"the authors explored the emergence and antecedents of racial stereotyping in 89 children ages 3–10 years. children completed a number of matching and sorting tasks, including a measure designed to assess their knowledge and application of both positive and negative in‐group and out‐group stereotypes. results indicate that children start to apply stereotypes to the out‐group starting around 6 years of age. controlling for a number of factors, 2 predictors contributed significantly toward uniquely explaining the use of these stereotypes: race salience (i.e., seeing and organizing by race) and essentialist thinking (i.e., believing that race cannot change). these results provide insight into how and when real‐world interventions aimed at altering the acquisition of racial stereotypes may be implemented.",1
"this paper exploits quasi-experimental variation in tariffs in southern africa to estimate trade elasticities. traded quantities respond only weakly to a 30 percent reduction in the average nominal tariff rate. trade flow data combined with primary data on firm behavior and bribe payments suggest that corruption is a potential explanation for the observed low elasticities. in contexts of pervasive corruption, even small bribes can significantly reduce tariffs, making tariff liberalization schemes less likely to affect the extensive and the intensive margins of firms' import behavior. the tariff liberalization scheme is, however, still associated with improved incentives to accurately report quantities of imported goods, and with a significant reduction in bribe transfers from importers to public officials.",1
"using a large and unique patent‐merger data set over the period 1984 to 2006, we show that companies with large patent portfolios and low r&d expenses are acquirers, while companies with high r&d expenses and slow growth in patent output are targets. further, technological overlap between firm pairs has a positive effect on transaction incidence, and this effect is reduced for firm pairs that overlap in product markets. we also show that acquirers with prior technological linkage to their target firms produce more patents afterwards. we conclude that synergies obtained from combining innovation capabilities are important drivers of acquisitions.",1
"previous research suggests that presenting redundant nonverbal semantic information in the form of gestures and/or pictures may aid word learning in first and foreign languages. but do nonverbal supports help all learners equally? we address this issue by examining the role of gestures and pictures as nonverbal supports for word learning in a novel (e.g. original/pretend) language in a sample of 62 preschoolers who differ in language abilities, language background, and gender. we tested children’s ability to learn novel words for familiar objects using a within-subjects design with three conditions: word-only; word + gesture; word + picture. children were assessed on english translation, immediate comprehension and follow-up comprehension 1 week later. overall performance on the tasks differed by characteristics of the learners. the importance of considering the interplay between learner characteristics and instructional strategies is discussed.",1
"does the perception of many close relationships as autonomy-supportive make students more motivated and competent? the goal of this study was to use latent class analysis (lca) to compare the educational correlates of having one vs. several autonomy-supportive relationships. participants were 1406 high school students (47% boys, 52% girls). lca revealed three groups: group 1 (17%) included students who perceived low autonomy support by their mother, father, and teacher; group 2 (7%) included students who perceived low autonomy support by their father, but moderate autonomy support by their mother and teacher; and group 3 (76%) included students who perceived all sources as moderately autonomy-supportive. results of multiple comparisons suggest that more is not necessarily better: students in group 2, who perceived low autonomy support by fathers, reported equivalent autonomous (intrinsic and identified) and controlled (external and introjected) regulations and perceived competence to those of students in group 3, who perceived all sources as moderately autonomy-supportive. one difference was that group 3 showed better academic achievement than group 2. results are discussed in light of research on close relationships and self-determination theory (sdt).",1
"we examined the importance of children’s classroom activity, defined as task-focused versus task-avoidance behavior, on different literacy outcomes in an orthographically consistent language. greek children (n = 95) were tested in kindergarten, grade 1, and grade 2 on measures of general cognitive ability, phonological awareness, ran, and short-term memory. the teachers of the children also assessed their task-focused behavior. nonword decoding, reading fluency, spelling, and reading comprehension measures were administered in grades 2 and 3. the results indicated that task-focused behavior accounted for unique variance in spelling and reading comprehension, even after controlling for the effects of autoregressor, non-verbal iq, and phonological processing.",1
"teacher turnover occurs during and at the end of the school year, although documentation of within-year turnover currently rests on anecdotal evidence. on average, over 4.6% of teachers turn over during the school year, which amounts to 25% of total annual turnover. teachers transfer within districts at higher rates at the beginning of the school year and leave teaching at higher rates at the beginning of the spring semester. higher performing teachers are less likely to turn over during the school year and less likely to turn over within the year than at the end of the year. teach for america corps members are much less likely and teachers from out of state much more likely to turn over during the school year than traditionally prepared teachers.",1
"this 3-year, mixed-methods study investigated the effects of teacher technology-enhanced professional development (tpd) on 20 teachers’ beliefs and practices. teachers in two middle schools located in neighboring rural, high-poverty districts in the southeastern united states participated in reform-based lessons and learned how to integrate technologies into their teaching over three summers and throughout the school year. mathematics and science assessment scores for 2,321 students both with and without tpd teachers were analyzed over the 3 years of teacher tpd. teachers’ reform-based teaching beliefs and their comfort using new technologies increased significantly, and all of the teachers integrated the use of technologies into their instruction. although some tpd teachers used technology in ways that transformed their roles and classroom practices, the majority of the teachers adopted technology in ways that improved efficiency and effectiveness. african american students who had more tpd teachers over more years experienced significant gains on end-of-grade mathematics and science tests. findings suggest that if teachers integrate technology into their instruction, large-scale changes in teachers’ practices are not necessary to enhance students’ learning, particularly for african american students.",1
"policymakers aiming to close the well-documented achievement gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students have increasingly turned their attention to issues of teacher quality. a number of studies have demonstrated that teachers are inequitably distributed across student subgroups by input measures, like experience and qualifications, as well as output measures, like value-added estimates of teacher performance, but these tend to focus on either individual measures of teacher quality or particular school districts. in this study, we present a comprehensive, descriptive analysis of the inequitable distribution of both input and output measures of teacher quality across various indicators of student disadvantage across all school districts in washington state. we demonstrate that in elementary school, middle school, and high school classrooms, virtually every measure of teacher quality we examine—experience, licensure exam scores, and value added—is inequitably distributed across every indicator of student disadvantage—free/reduced-price lunch status, underrepresented minority, and low prior academic performance. finally, we decompose these inequities to the district, school, and classroom levels and find that patterns in teacher sorting at all three levels contribute to the overall teacher quality gaps.",1
"research on science achievement disparities by gender and race/ethnicity often neglects the beginning of the pipeline in the early grades. we address this limitation using nationally representative data following students from grades 3 to 8. we find that the black–white science test score gap (–1.07 sd in grade 3) remains stable over these years, the hispanic–white gap narrows (–.85 to –.65 sd), and the asian–white grade 3 gap (–.31 sd) closes by grade 8. the female–male grade 3 gap (–.23 sd) may narrow slightly by eighth grade. accounting for prior math and reading achievement, socioeconomic status, and classroom fixed effects, grade 8 racial/ethnic gaps are not statistically significant. the grade 8 science gender gap disappears after controlling for prior math achievement.",1
"institutions often offer a menu of contracts to consumers in an attempt to create a separating equilibrium that reveals borrower types and provides better pricing. we test the effectiveness of a specific set of contracts in the mortgage market: mortgage points. points allow borrowers to exchange an upfront amount for a decrease in the mortgage rate. we document that, on average, points takers lose about $700. also, points takers are less financially savvy (less educated, older), and they make mistakes on other dimensions (e.g., inefficiently refinancing their mortgages). overall, our results show that borrowers overestimate how long they will stay with the mortgage.",1
"we investigate whether organizations can create value by introducing visual transparency between consumers and producers. although operational transparency has been shown to improve consumer perceptions of service value, existing theory posits that increased contact between consumers and producers may diminish work performance. two field and two laboratory experiments in food service settings suggest that transparency that (1) allows customers to observe operational processes (process transparency) and (2) allows employees to observe customers (customer transparency) not only improves customer perceptions but also increases service quality and efficiency. the introduction of this transparency contributed to a 22.2% increase in customer-reported quality and reduced throughput times by 19.2%. laboratory studies revealed that customers who observed process transparency perceived greater employee effort and thus were more appreciative of the employees and valued the service more. employees who observed customer transparency felt that their work was more appreciated and more impactful and thus were more satisfied with their work and more willing to exert effort. we find that transparency, by visually revealing operating processes to consumers and beneficiaries to producers, generates a positive feedback loop through which value is created for both parties.",1
"we find that inventory productivity strongly predicts future stock returns among a sample of publicly listed u.s. retailers during the period from 1985 to 2010. a zero-cost portfolio investment strategy, which consists of buying from the two highest and selling from the two lowest quintiles formed on inventory turnover, earns more than 1% average monthly abnormal return benchmarked to the fama–french–carhart four-factor model. our results are robust to different measures of inventory productivity, distinct from the well-known firm characteristics known to generate abnormal returns, and not driven by a particular subsample period. a longitudinal analysis of portfolio returns over longer holding periods shows that although inventory productivity is predictive of stock returns, its information dissipates about one to two years after release.",1
"multimedia integration signals highlight correspondences between text and pictures with the aim of supporting learning from multimedia. a recent meta-analysis revealed that only learners with low domain-specific prior knowledge benefit from multimedia integration signals. to more thoroughly investigate the influence of prior knowledge on the multimedia signaling effect in a more ecologically valid context, we conducted a quasi-experimental field study with 8th graders. they learned with a digital multimedia textbook in 1 of the 2 versions: (a) a basic version with signals that supported only the selection and organization of information from either text or pictures or (b) an extended version with additional multimedia integration signals to support the integration of information from text and pictures (e.g., color coding, deictic references). results of a contrast analysis revealed that low-prior-knowledge learners learned better with the extended version compared with the basic version, whereas adding multimedia integration signals was detrimental for learning outcomes of high-prior-knowledge learners. this expertise reversal effect could only partially be explained by cognitive load measures, in that high-prior-knowledge learners had higher extraneous cognitive load in the condition with multimedia integration signals. the results suggest a need for a more individualized multimedia design that considers students’ prior knowledge.",0
"

residential segregation along ethnic categories has been associated with social disadvantages of minority group members. it is considered a driving factor in the reproduction of social inequalities and a pressing issue in many societies. while most research focuses on neighbourhood segregation in the united states, less is known about the origins of ethnic enclaves in european cities. we use complete data of residential moves within stockholm municipality between 1990 and 2003 to test whether ‘ethnic flight’ or ‘ethnic avoidance’ drives segregation dynamics. on the macro level, we analyse the binary infrastructure of natives’ and immigrants’ movement flows between 128 neighbourhoods with exponential random graph models, which account for systemic dependencies in the structure of the housing market. on the micro level, we analyse individual-level panel data to account for differences between native and immigrant in- and out-movers. our results show strong support for ‘ethnic avoidance’ on both levels—native swedes avoid moving into neighbourhoods where ethnic minorities live. this is even more pronounced when controlling for socio-economic factors. at the same time, there is only little support for ‘ethnic flight’ on the micro level—native swedes are only marginally more likely to move out of neighbourhoods where many immigrants live.",1
