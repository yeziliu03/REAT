In addition to store price beliefs, the survey collected panel members’ perceptions on other image components of the stores. Surveys were conducted in weeks 16 and 40 of every year, with an extra survey wave in week 5 of 2004.

The author uses a fixed effects model with a  dependent variable of economic performance (measured by GDP growth; set to t + 2 to allow a time lapse for local officials' effort to translate into economic outcomes). The key independent variable -- connected to provincial secretary -- is a binary indicator that takes the value of 1 if either the city secretary or the mayor is connected to the provincial secretary. City fixed effects capture the time-invariant heterogeneity across cities, and the year fixed effects are allowed to vary arbitrarily by province in order to absorb any province-specific economic or political shocks. The author also includes the following time-varying economic and leadership covariates: the levels of Log GDP, GDP Growth, Log Population, and Log Fixed Asset Investment, all measured in the final years of the city secretary’s and the mayor’s predecessors’ terms; Net Transfer, which is the difference between fiscal expenditure and revenue at t + 1; a set of standard demographics, such as Age, Gender, and College Education, for both the city secretary and the mayor; and controls for city leaders' tenure length.

The authors used multinomial logistic regression analyses that imputed missing values on the independent variables using standard multiple imputation techniques.

The primary independent variable was expectations to have a birth by age 20. In 1997, respondents ages 15 and older were asked ‘‘What is the percent chance you will become the mom/dad of a baby sometime between now and when you turn 20?’’ Responses ranged from 0 to 100.  The regression model also controlled for age at first sex, highest level of math taken in high school, high school GPA, race, parental education, and family structure in 1997.

Seven cohorts of subjects (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years of age at baseline) and their primary caregivers were interviewed up to three times between 1997 and 2002. Because the authors are interested in the period of adolescent adjustment, the authors limit the sample to the 9-, 12-, and 15-year age cohorts. The authors rely on a series of split, multi-level regression models (overdispersed Poisson) and equality of coefficients tests to determine whether immigrant status conditions the impact of exposure to peer delinquency on violent behavior. The dependent variable is a measure of self-reported violence similar to that examined in previous research. The key independent variable is constructed from a 6 item peer deviance scale, and the authors define first-generation immigrants as individuals who were born outside the United States. Third-generation or higher immigrants are defined as those who were born in the United States and whose parents also were born in the United States.

WLkV,"Behavior in multistage elimination tournaments is studied with two main treatments. The first is a two-stage tournament (TS) in which four participants compete for being promoted to the second stage. Promotion depends on subjects’ output, which is a function of costly effort and an individual noise term. The two subjects with the lowest output levels in the first stage are eliminated from further competition and receive a low wage. The two subjects with the highest output levels in the first stage are promoted, that is, they are allowed to take part in the second stage where they compete against each other again. The subject with the highest second-stage output receives a high wage, whereas the other finalist is paid an intermediate wage. The authors compare this treatment to a one-stage tournament (OS) in which four subjects compete once for two top positions. In OS, wages for promoted subjects are chosen such that the tournament is strategically equivalent to the first stage of TS. This means that promoted subjects in OS earn the sum of the intermediate wage in TS and the monetary equivalent of the second-stage option value in that tournament, implying that equilibrium effort is the same in both treatments. Comparing OS and TS thus allows testing whether strategic equivalence translates into behavioral equivalence.

The authors' specific focus is on “skill correlates,” which refers to variables that are correlated with labor market outcomes. They first create a set of youth characteristics that correlate with adult outcomes and are comparable across NLSY97 and NLSY79; then create a skill vector based on race, gender, parental education, intact family, Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score, eduction, and school-to-work transition; and then use the skill vector to generate counterfactual wage distributions for what members of the NLSY79 cohort would have earned if they had the observed skill correlates of the NLSY97 and the wage function remained unchanged. For the evidence of the finding used by the SCORE program, the authors compare the observed outcome in the 1979 cohorts to the counterfactual statistics based on the skill vector described above -- one of the results of interest (and the result chosen for the SCORE program) is the comparison of the means, using the counterfactual specified in Model 6 (column 3, table 4).",1,0.5559349060058594,0.8627218752545454
