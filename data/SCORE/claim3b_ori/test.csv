A measure of uncertainty in the system is created by calculating the Visit Entropy of the time-series trajectory on different states visited by a participant (see Fig. 1). Finally, to investigate prediction of depressive symptoms and trait rumination 6 months later (Time 2), the authors conducted a series of hierarchical regression analyses (HRA); the focal analysis is the HRA on the RMD group, with BDI-II (Beck Depression Inventory–II), MADRS depression rating scale, brooding, and reflection score at Time 1 in the first step and entropy in the second step as predictors and BDI-II at Time 2 as the dependent variable.",0,0.4906828999519348,0.3087968852090909

The interaction of the change in noncash assets with the financial constraints indicator can be interpreted as a test of whether the market responds more favorably to investments made by constrained firms. Results are reported in Table 6. The dependent variable is stock return over fiscal year minus the return on a benchmark portfolio. Regressions are estimated using OLS.
