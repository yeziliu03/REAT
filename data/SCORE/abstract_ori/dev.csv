qZQ2,"do economic downturns in the global north undermine worker safety in the global south? literature suggests that bilateral trade linkages lead to the diffusion of “good” labor standards from importing countries of the global north to exporting countries of the global south. the crucial mechanism is the ability and willingness of importing firms to deploy their market leverage and ask for improved labor standards from their overseas suppliers. yet, cost-cutting pressures emanating from economic downturns might lead the same importing firms to give lower priority to worker safety in their overseas supply chains. when importing firms demand price reductions, overseas suppliers might respond by reducing wages, ignoring safety regulations, and working their labor force for longer hours. the observable implication is that worker safety in the global south may deteriorate during economic downturns in their export markets located in the global north. we evaluate our hypothesis using a panel of 83 developing countries for the period during 1980–2009, and find that economic downturns in developed country markets are associated with significant increases in non-fatal occupational injury rates in developing countries. the injury-increasing effect is more pronounced in developing countries with weak workers' rights protection.",0,0.5570105910301208,0.4733688683090909

l7mz,"since the adoption of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and sustainable development goals (sdgs) by the un general assembly in september 2015, interest in building effective development partnerships has grown in the both the international development discipline and practitioner community. responding to this trend, many scholars and policy-makers highlight participatory development cooperation among state actors and non-state actors as a means of achieving comprehensive development goals. despite this emphasis, however, only a handful of empirical studies have examined whether such partnerships have any meaningful relationship with project outcomes. this study aims to answer whether and to what extent different types of implementing partnerships (i.e., state or non-state implementing agencies) affect the outcome of development projects. using the world bank independent evaluation group (wbieg) project data with newly constructed implementing partnership variables, this study shows that implementing partnerships with host country governmental agencies tend to produce a less successful outcome compared to partnerships with non-state actors, and on average only attain moderate-level outcomes. projects implemented by non-state actors, on the other hand, are likely to result in higher level project outcomes. the paper further tests these findings by analyzing the relationship between the number of state and non-state partners interacting in a project and the subsequent project outcome. this result suggests that an increased number of non-state actor participants leads to a better project outcome; this positive participatory effect, however, diminishes as the number of governmental implementers increases.

7eY9,"we use hospital-level discharge data from cardiac patients in california to estimate the effects of focus on operational performance. we examine focus at three distinct levels of the organization-at the firm level, at the operating unit level, and at the process flow level. we find that focus at each of these levels is associated with improved outcomes, namely, faster services at higher levels of quality, as indicated by lower lengths of stay (los) and reduced mortality rates. we then analyze the extent to which the superior operational outcome is driven by focused hospitals truly excelling in their operations or by focused hospitals simply ""cherry-picking"" easy-to-treat patients. to do this, we use an instrumental variables estimation strategy that effectively randomizes the assignment of patients to hospitals. after controlling for selective patient admissions, the previously observed benefits of firm level focus disappear; focused hospitals no longer demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in los or mortality rate. however, at more granular measures of focus within the hospital (e.g., operating unit level), we find that more focus leads to a shorter los, even after controlling for selective admission effects.",1,0.566029965877533,0.5498809535
XROv,instrumental variables (iv) estimates show strong class-size effects in southern italy. but italy's mezzogiorno is distinguished by manipulation of standardized test scores as well as by economic disadvantage. iv estimates suggest small classes increase manipulation. we argue that score manipulation is a consequence of teacher shirking. iv estimates of a causal model for achievement as a function of class size and score manipulation show that class-size effects on measured achievement are driven entirely by the relationship between class size and manipulation. these results illustrate how consequential score manipulation can arise even in assessment systems with few accountability concerns.,1,0.562799334526062,0.8146562813909092
Lm9B,"community-rating regulations equalize the insurance premiums faced by the healthy and the unhealthy. intended reductions in the unhealthy's premiums can be undone, however, if the healthy forgo coverage. the severity of this adverse selection problem hinges largely on how health care costs are distributed across market participants. theoretically, i show that medicaid expansions can combat adverse selection by removing high cost individuals from the relevant risk pool. empirically, i find that private coverage rates improved significantly in community-rated markets when states expanded medicaid's coverage of relatively unhealthy adults. the effects of these health policy instruments are fundamentally linked.",1,0.5331587791442871,0.8042912867272727
xJz3,"political and economic transition is often blamed for russia's 40 percent surge in deaths between 1990 and 1994. highlighting that increases in mortality occurred primarily among alcohol-related causes and among working-age men (the heaviest drinkers), this paper investigates an alternative explanation: the demise of the 1985-1988 gorbachev anti-alcohol campaign. using archival sources to build a new oblast-year dataset spanning 1978-2000, we find a variety of evidence suggesting that the campaign's end explains a large share of the mortality crisis, implying that russia's transition to capitalism and democracy was not as lethal as commonly suggested.

kBJZ,"lottery estimates suggest massachusetts' urban charter schools boost achievement well beyond that of traditional urban public schools students, while nonurban charters reduce achievement from a higher baseline. the fact that urban charters are most effective for poor nonwhites and low-baseline achievers contributes to, but does not fully explain, these differences. we therefore link school-level charter impacts to school inputs and practices. the relative efficacy of urban lottery sample charters is accounted for by these schools' embrace of the no excuses approach to urban education. in our massachusetts sample, non-no-excuses urban charters are no more effective than nonurban charters.",1,0.5061346292495728,0.5312502313272728
